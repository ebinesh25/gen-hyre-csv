1.A car travels 700 miles in seven hours, each hour covering 20 miles more than the previous hour. How many miles did it travel in the first hour?

**Options:
**A.10

B.25

C.20

D.40

**Answer : D.40**

**Solution:**

Let x be the number of miles the car traveled in the first hour.

Then, in the second hour, it covered x + 25 miles.

In the third hour, it covered x + 50 miles. And so on.

We can set up the following equation based on the given information:

x + (x + 20) + (x + 40) + (x + 60) + (x + 80) + (x + 100) + (x + 120) = 700

Simplifying this equation, we get:

7x + 420 = 700

7x = 280

x = 40

6\. The sequence 12, 18, x, y, 36 is an arithmetic progression (AP). Find the values of x and y.

**Options:
**A. x = 22, y = 28

B. x = 24, y = 30

C. x = 26, y = 32

D. x = 20, y = 26

**Answer: B. x = 24, y = 30
**

**Solution:**

Since the sequence is an arithmetic progression, the common difference (d) between consecutive terms is constant.

First, let's find the common difference using the first two terms:

d = 18 - 12 = 6

Now we can find x and y by adding the common difference to each previous term:

x = 18 + 6 = 24

y = 24 + 6 = 30

Let's verify our answer:

First term: 12

Second term: 12 + 6 = 18

Third term: 18 + 6 = 24

Fourth term: 24 + 6 = 30

Fifth term: 30 + 6 = 36

Therefore, x = 24 and y = 30.

10.What is the sum of the first 15 even natural numbers?

**Options:
**A. 190

B.240

C. 210

D. 196

**Answer: B.240
**

**Solution:**

The sum of the first n even natural numbers is given by the formula n(n+1).

Since we want the sum of the first 15 even natural numbers,

we can substitute n=15 into the formula to get: 15(15+1) = 240.

Therefore, the sum of the first 15 even natural numbers is 240.

11.Does the following sentence have an S-V error? She and her friends was waiting outside.

Options:
 Yes
 No

Answer: Yes

Explanation: The subject "She and her friends" is a compound subject and is plural, so it requires the plural verb "were".

12.Rearrange the following five sentences in proper sequence:

1. Realising his mistake, Aman apologised.
2. Without checking facts, Aman believed the rumour.
3. Aman heard a rumour during lunch.
4. His friend explained the truth.
5. He avoided speaking to his friend.

Which sentence should come second?

Options:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5

Answer: 2

Explanation: After hearing the rumour, Aman believed it and got angry.

NOTE: This question has 5 options but answer is 2 (within first 4), so we keep first 4 options.

13.A modern education system should not depend on outdated methods nor rely on obsolete technology.

Options:
 should not depend
 should neither depend
 should either depend
 No correction required

Answer: should neither depend

Explanation: The correlative conjunction "neither" must be paired with "nor".

14.Fill in the blank with the appropriate determiner:

_____ of the students who participated have been selected.

Options:
 A. Few
 B. Some
 C. Every
 D. No

Answer: B

Explanation: "Some" correctly indicates that not all, but a certain number have been selected.

NOTE: Original had 5 options (A-E), but option E was dropped. Answer B is within A-D.

15.Choose the best alternative for the underlined phrase:

The company decided to take the supplier to the court over the breach of contract.

to the court
 in the court
 to court
 into the court

Answer: to court

Explanation: The correct idiomatic expression is "to court".

## CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR CONVERSION:

0. **MOST CRITICAL - Option Prefix Removal:**
   - ALWAYS strip "A.", "B.", "C.", "D.", "E." from option text
   - "A. Economical" → "Economical" (NOT "A. Economical")
   - "B. Wasteful" → "Wasteful" (NOT "B. Wasteful")
   - **VERIFY YOUR OUTPUT:** Check that NO option starts with a letter + period!

1. **CSV QUOTING - ALWAYS QUOTE THESE FIELDS:**
   - **ALL Options** - Quote every single option, even if no commas
   - **Question** - Always quote
   - **Tags** - Always quote (always has commas)
   - **Category** - Always quote (may have commas like "Logical Reasoning,Directions")
   - **Answer Explanation** - Always quote
   - This prevents ALL column shift issues!

2. **DETERMINE MAXIMUM OPTION COUNT FIRST**
   - Read ALL questions first to find maximum option count (could be 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6)
   - CSV header will have Options1 through Options[maxCount]
   - Each question row has its actual optionCount and only that many non-empty options

3. **Option Count = ACTUAL number of options** (2, 3, 4, 5, or 6)
   - 2 options: Set optionCount=2, fill Options1-2
   - 4 options: Set optionCount=4, fill Options1-4
   - 5 options: Set optionCount=5, fill Options1-5
   - 6 options: Set optionCount=6, fill Options1-6
   - Options beyond actual count are empty strings

4. **Every row must have consistent column count** based on maxOptionCount

5. **Text-based answers:** Match the answer text to find the correct option number (1-6)

6. **Letter answers (A, B, C, D, E):** Convert to numbers (A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, E=5)

7. **Number answers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6):** Use directly as the answer
