Since the bakery is able to sell all the cupcakes produced, the revenue will depend on the number of cupcakes sold during the promotion and the number of cupcakes sold after the promotion. Let's assume that the number of cupcakes sold during the promotion is x. Then, the number of cupcakes sold after the promotion is (2000 - x). Total revenue = Revenue per unit * Number of units sold during the promotion + Revenue per unit * Number of units sold after the promotion Total revenue = $3x + $1(2000 - x) Total revenue = $3x + $2000 - $1x Total revenue = $2x + $2000 To break even, the total revenue must be equal to the total cost.

From the given information, we know that the hose can fill the tank in 3 hours, so its filling rate is: F = 1 tank volume / 3 hours = 1/3 tank volume per hour Similarly, we know that the hose takes 4 hours to fill the tank due to the crack, so the combined rate of filling and emptying is: F - E = 1 tank volume / 4 hours = 1/4 tank volume per hour Now, we can set up an equation to find the crack's emptying rate: 1/3 - E = 1/4 To solve for E, we can rearrange the equation: E = 1/3 - 1/4 E = (4 - 3) / (3 * 4) E = 1 / 12 tank volume per hour Now that we know the crack's emptying rate, we can determine the time it will take to empty the tank completely.

When the can is filled with B, the total amount of liquid B in the can becomes 4x + y liters. Therefore, we can write: 4x + y - (4/13) x 13x = 4x + y - 4x = y Substituting the value of y, we get: y = 561x/5 Therefore, the amount of liquid B in the can initially was: 4x = (5/9) x 13x = 65x/9 liters To find the amount of liquid A in the can initially, we can subtract the amount of liquid B from the total mixture: 9x + 4x = 13x So, the amount of liquid A in the can initially was: 9x = (9/13) x 13x = 117x/13 liters Therefore, the can initially contained 117/13 = 9 liters of liquid A.",,,,,

objective,The number obtained by interchanging the two digits of a two-digit number is greater than the original number by 27. The sum of the two digits of the number is 13. What is the original number?,4,58,69,83,92,1,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","Let's assume the original two-digit number as ""10x + y"", where x represents the tens digit and y represents the ones digit. According to the problem, we have the following information: Interchanging the digits gives us the number ""10y + x"". The interchanged number is greater than the original number by 27, so we have the equation: (10y + x) = (10x + y) + 27. We also know that the sum of the two digits is 13, so we have the equation: x + y = 13. To solve this problem, we can use the given equations to find the values of x and y that satisfy all the conditions. From the equation x + y = 13, we can solve for x in terms of y: x = 13 - y. Substituting this into the equation (10y + x) = (10x + y) + 27, we have: 10y + (13 - y) = 10(13 - y) + y + 27. Simplifying the equation: 9y + 13 = 130 - 10y + y + 27. Combine like terms: 9y + 13 = 157 - 9y. Add 9y to both sides: 18y + 13 = 157. Subtract 13 from both sides: 18y = 144. Divide both sides by 18: y = 8.

objective,The difference between two consecutive odd integers is 6. The average of these two integers is 17. What is the value of the larger odd integer?,4,21,23,25,27,2,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","Let's assume the two consecutive odd integers are x and y, where x is greater than y. So, x - y = 6 and (x + y)/2 = 17. By solving these two equations, we get x = 23 and y = 17. Therefore, the larger odd integer is x = 23.",,,,,
objective,"Mr. Manmohan calculated the average of 10 'three digit numbers'. But due to mistake, he reversed the digits of a number and thus his average increased by 19.8. The difference between the unit digit and hundreds digit of that number is :",4,8,4,2,can't be determined,3,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","Answer: C.2 Solution The correct option is C 2 Remember abc−cba99(a−c),where abc and cba are the three digit numbers and (a, c)≠ 0 (First number = 100a + 10b + c; Second number = 100c + 10b + a. So First number - Second number = 99a - 99b = 99(a-b)) Again since the difference in average = 19.8 Therefore the difference in total = 19.8 × 10 = 198 Thus, 99 × (a - c) = 198 (a - c) = 2.",,,,,
objective,"A train travels from Station A to Station B at a speed of 60 km per hour and returns from Station B to Station A at a speed of 90 km per hour. If the total distance between the two stations is 180 km, what is the average speed of the train for the entire journey in km per hour?",4,72,36,80,85,2,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers",Average speed is given by the formula: Total distance / Total time. Total distance = 180 km (round trip). Time taken for the journey from A to B = 180 km / 60 km/h = 3 hours. Time taken for the return journey from B to A = 180 km / 90 km/h = 2 hours. Total time for the round trip = 3 hours + 2 hours = 5 hours. Average speed = 180 km / 5 hours = 36 km/h .,,,,,
objective,"In a supermarket, the average weight of the first 40 fruits is 150 grams, while the average weight of the remaining 10 fruits is 200 grams. What is the average weight of all the fruits in the supermarket?",4,160 grams,165 grams,170 grams,175 grams,1,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","Let's assume the total weight of the first 40 fruits is 40 grams, and the total weight of the remaining 10 fruits is 10 grams. The average weight of the first 40 fruits is 150 grams, so 40x/40 = 150, and x = 150. The average weight of the remaining 10 fruits is 200 grams, so 10y/10 = 200, and y = 200. The total weight of all the fruits in the supermarket is 40x + 10y = 40(150) + 10(200) = 6000 + 2000 = 8000 grams. The average weight of all the fruits is 8000 grams / 50 fruits = 160 grams.",,,,,
