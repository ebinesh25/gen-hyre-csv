Answer: B. 42


Solution:
Add all the numbers in the set: 14 + 28 + 42 + 56 + 70 = 210.
Divide the sum (210) by the number of elements in the set (5): 210 ÷ 5 = 42.
The answer is 42, so the correct choice is B) 42.
2.The average score of players A, B, and C is 66 points. If the average score of players A and B is 72 points, what is the score of player C?
Options:
 A. 48 points
B. 54 points
C. 60 points
D. 66 points
Answer: B. 54 points
Explanation:
Average of A, B, C is 66 → A + B + C = 198.
Average of A, B is 72 → A + B = 144.
Substitute into first: 144 + C = 198.
So, C = 198-144=54
3.A baker made 40 pastries in the first batch and 28 pastries in the second batch. How many pastries must be made in the third batch so that the average becomes 35 pastries per batch?
Options:
 A. 32
B. 36

5. The average score of 16 students in a math exam is 80, and the average score of 24 students in a science exam is 75. What is the average score of all 40 students together?


Options:
A. 76
B. 77
C. 78
D. 79

Answer: B. 77

Explanation:
Average score of 16 students in math = 80.
Total score of math students = 16 × 80 = 1280.
Average score of 24 students in science = 75.
Total score of science students = 24 × 75 = 1800.
Total score of all students = 1280 + 1800 = 3080.
Total number of students = 16 + 24 = 40.
Combined average score = 3080 ÷ 40 = 77.

7.Three years ago the average age of a group of 6 friends was 36 years. A new friend joined the group, and the average age of the group is the same today (36 years). What is the present age of the new friend?
Options: 
A. 18 years 
B. 21 years 
C. 24 years 
D. 27 years
Answer: A. 18 years
Explanation: 
Three years ago the total age of 6 friends = 6 × 36 = 216 years. 
After 3 years their ages increase by 6 × 3 = 18 years, so their current total = 216 + 18 = 234 years. 
When the new friend joins, the group has 7 people and the average remains 36, so total = 7 × 36 = 252 years. 
Therefore the present age of the new friend = 252 − 234 = 18 years.
8.The average height of 4 students P, Q, R, and S is 150 cm. Another student T joins the group and the average becomes 153 cm. If another student U, whose height is 5 cm more than T, replaces student P, then the average height of Q, R, S, T, and U becomes 154 cm. What is the height of student P?
Options:
 A. 160 cm
B. 162 cm
C. 165 cm
D. 168 cm
Answer: C. 165 cm
Explanation:
Initial total height = 4 × 150 = 600 cm. 
With T joining: (600 + t)/5 = 153 ⇒ 600 + t = 765 ⇒ t = 165 cm. 
U = t + 5 = 170 cm. Now sum of Q+R+S+T+U = 5 × 154 = 770. 
But (Q+R+S+T+U) = (P+Q+R+S + T) − P + U = (600 + 165) − P + 170 = 935 − P. 
So 935 − P = 770 ⇒ P = 935 − 770 = 165 cm.
9.The average weight of 29 students and a teacher in a class is 60 kg. If the weight of the teacher is excluded, the average weight of the students is reduced by 4 kg. What is the weight of the teacher?


Options:
A. 176 kg
B. 120 kg
C. 140 kg
D. 160 kg

Answer: A. 176 kg


Solution :
Let's assume that the total weight of the 29 students is x.
So, the average weight of the group (29 students + 1 teacher) is 60 kg, so:
(x + T) / 30 = 60.
x + T = 1800.
Where T is the weight of the teacher.
Next, when we exclude the teacher, the average weight of the students (29 students only) becomes 56 kg, so:
x / 29 = 56.
x = 1624.
Now we have the values of x and T, we can solve for T:
1800 = 1624 + T.
T = 176.


10.The average marks of 14 students are 85. If the average marks increase by 5 when Rahul, one of the students, leaves the group, what were Rahul's marks?


Options:
A. 65
B. 20
C. 55
D. 60

Answer: B. 20


Solution :
Let's assume the total marks of the 14 students is x. So,
x / 14 = 85.
x = 1190.
Next, when Rahul leaves the group,the average marks of the remaining 13 students becomes 90, so:
y / 13 = 90.
y = 1170.
Now we have the values of x and y,
we can find Rahul's marks:
x = y + R.
1190 = 1170 + R.
R = 20.


11.The average marks of a student in 15 quizzes is 78. If the average for the first 10 quizzes is 81, then find the average for the last 5 quizzes.

Options:
A. 70
B. 72
C. 74
D. 76

Answer: B. 72

Explanation:
Total for 15 quizzes = 15×78 = 1170. 
Total for first 10 = 10×81 = 810.
Marks in last 5 = 1170 − 810 = 360. 
Average for last 5 = 360 ÷ 5 = 72.


12.The average age of a family of 6 members was 40 years. One of the sons left home and the average age of the remaining members became 36 years. What is the age of the son who left?

Options:
A. 50 years
B. 55 years
C. 60 years
D. 65 years

Answer: C. 60 years

Explanation: 
Initial total = 6×40 = 240. 
Remaining total = 5×36 = 180. 
Age of the son = 240 − 180 = 60 years.


13.In a group of 13 people, the teacher is 40 years old and the class monitor is 36 years old. If their ages are excluded, the average age of the remaining people is 2 years less than the average age of the entire group. What is the average age of the whole group?

Options:
A. 25
B. 26
C. 27
D. 28

Answer: C. 27

Explanation:
Let  whole group average = x. 
Sum = 13x. 
Sum of remaining 11 = 11(x − 2). 
So 11(x − 2) + 40 + 36 = 13x → 11x − 22 + 76 = 13x → 54 = 2x → x = 27.
14.In a group of people, one person's weight was recorded incorrectly as 87 kg instead of 72 kg. Due to this mistake, the average weight of the group increased by 1 kg. How many people were in the group?
Options: 
A. 12
B. 15
C. 18
D. 20
Answer: B. 15
Explanation: 
Let the number of people in the group be n. 
One person's weight was incorrectly recorded as 87 kg instead of 72 kg. 
Error in total weight = 87 - 72 = 15 kg. 
This error increased the average by 1 kg. 
Since: (Error in total) / (Number of people) = Increase in average 
We have: 15 / n = 1 
Therefore: n = 15 / 1 = 15 people.
15.A student scores 94 marks in the 12th exam and thus increases his average by 5. Find his average after the 12th exam.
Options: 
A. 34 
B. 39 
C. 44 
D. 49
Answer: B. 39
Explanation: 
Let the student's average before the 12th exam be x. Total marks in first 11 exams = 11x. After the 12th exam, total marks = 11x + 94. New average = (11x + 94) / 12. According to the problem, the new average is x + 5. So: (11x + 94) / 12 = x + 5 12(x + 5) = 11x + 94 12x + 60 = 11x + 94 x = 34. Therefore, average after the 12th exam = x + 5 = 34 + 5 = 39.
16.A sports team initially had an average score of 75 points in 12 games. After playing 8 more games, their average score increased to 80 points. What was their average score in the additional 8 games?

Options:
A. 85
B. 87.5
C. 95
D. 100

Answer: B. 87.5.


Solution:
Let the average score in the additional 8 games be "x."
So, the total score in the additional 8 games was 8 * x.
The total score in the first 12 games was 12 * 75 = 900 points.
After playing 8 more games, the total number of games became 12 + 8 = 20, and the average score became 80.
We can write an equation as follows:
(900 + 8x) / 20 = 80.
Solving for x:
900 + 8x = 1600.
8x = 700
x = 87.5.
17.A family of six members went to a zoo. Five of them purchased entry tickets for Rs. 40 each, and the sixth member spent Rs. 30 more than the average expenditure of all six. What was the total money spent by them?
Options: 
A. Rs. 240 
B. Rs. 260 
C. Rs. 276 
D. Rs. 280
Answer: C. Rs. 276
Explanation: 
Let the average expenditure of all six family members be x. 
Five family members spent Rs. 40 each, and the sixth member spent (x + 30). 
Total expenditure = 5 × 40 + (x + 30) = 200 + x + 30 = 230 + x. 
Since the average is x, total expenditure = 6x. 
Therefore: 6x = 230 + x 5x = 230 x = 46. 
So, the total amount spent by all six family members is 6 × 46 = Rs. 276.
18.When a player weighing 72 kg left a team of 30 players, the average weight of the remaining players increased by 200 g (0.2 kg). What is the new average weight of the team?
Options: 
A. 68.0 kg 
B. 72.0 kg 
C. 77.8 kg 
D. 78.0 kg
Answer: D. 78.0 kg
Explanation: 
Let the original average weight be x kg. 
Original total weight of 30 players = 30x. 
When the 72-kg player leaves, remaining 29 players' total = 30x - 72. 
New average = x + 0.2 (increases by 0.2 kg). 
Therefore: (30x - 72) / 29 = x + 0.2 30x - 72 = 29(x + 0.2) 30x - 72 = 29x + 5.8 x = 77.8 kg. New average weight = x + 0.2 = 77.8 + 0.2 = 78.0 kg.
19. The average height of a group of 20 people is 160 cm. The average height of the first 10 people is 155 cm, and the average height of the last 5 people is 165 cm. If the heights of the 11th to 15th persons are all equal, what is the height of each of these 5 people?
Options: 
A. 160 cm 
B. 165 cm 
C. 155 cm 
D. 170 cm
Answer: B. 165 cm
Explanation: 
Total height of 20 people = 20 × 160 = 3200 cm. 
Total height of first 10 people = 10 × 155 = 1550 cm. 
Total height of last 5 people (people 16-20) = 5 × 165 = 825 cm. 
Total height of people 11-15 = 3200 - 1550 - 825 = 825 cm. 
Since all 5 people (11th to 15th) have equal height: 825 ÷ 5 = 165 cm.
20.The average height of a group of 18 people is 160 cm. The average height of the first 8 people is 155 cm, and the average height of the last 6 people is 165 cm. If the heights of the 9th to 12th persons are all equal, what is the height of each of these 4 people?
Options: 
A. 160 cm 
B. 162.5 cm 
C. 165 cm 
D. 150 cm
Answer: B. 162.5 cm
Explanation: 
Total height of 18 people = 18 × 160 = 2880 cm. 
Total height of first 8 people = 8 × 155 = 1240 cm. 
Total height of last 6 people (people 13-18) = 6 × 165 = 990 cm. 
Total height of people 9-12 = 2880 - 1240 - 990 = 650 cm. 
Since all 4 people (9th to 12th) have equal height: 650 ÷ 4 = 162.5 cm.
21.The average weight of all the employees in a company is 70 kg. The average weight of 6 managers is 80 kg, and the average weight of the rest of the employees is 65 kg. How many employees are there in the company?


Options:
A. 20
B. 30
C. 40
D. 50

Answer: C. 40


Solution:
Let's say the total number of employees in the company is x.
The average weight of all the employees in the company is 70 kg, so the total weight of all the employees is x * 70.
The average weight of 6 managers is 80 kg, so the total weight of the 6 managers is 6 * 80 = 480 kg.
The average weight of the rest of the employees is 65 kg, so the total weight of the rest of the employees is (x - 6) * 65.
Equating the two, we get x * 70 = 480 + (x - 6) * 65.
Expanding and simplifying, we get x * 70 = 480 + 65x - 390.
Solving for x, we get x = 40.
So, the total number of employees in the company is 40.


22.In a store, 45% of the items are electronics. All the remaining items are clothing. The cost of each electronic item is Rs. 5,000, and the cost of each clothing item is Rs. 2,000. What is the average cost of all the items in the store?


Options:
A. Rs. 2,750
B. Rs. 3,000
C. Rs. 3,350
D. Rs. 3,500

Answer: C. Rs. 3,350


Solution:
Let's say there are 100 items in the store.
Then, 45 electronics items and 55 clothing items.
The total cost of all the electronics items is 45 * 5,000 = Rs. 225,000.
The total cost of all the clothing items is 55 * 2,000 = Rs. 110,000.
The total cost of all the items in the store is 225,000 + 110,000 = Rs. 335,000.
The average cost of each item is 335,000/100 = Rs. 3,350.


23.The average score of a team in a cricket match is 250 runs. The average score of the batsmen is 280 runs, while the average score of the bowlers is 200 runs. What is the ratio of batsmen to bowlers in the team?


Options:
A. 4:3
B. 3:4
C. 5:2
D. 2:5

Answer: B. 3:4


Solution:
Let's assume there are x players in the team.
Then, the total runs scored is 250x.
Let's also assume that there are b batsmen and w bowlers in the team.
Then, the total runs scored by the batsmen is 280b, and the total runs scored by the bowlers is 200w.
So, we have the following two equations:
b + w = x (the total number of players)
280b + 200w = 250x (the total runs scored)
280b + 200w = 250(b + w)
Solving these equations, we get the batsmen to bowlers ratio as 3:4.

Solution:
Total mondays in the month =5 hence total visitors on mondays during the month are 138×5= 690
Total visitors of the rest 25 days
84×25= 2100
Grand total = 2790 ÷ 30= 93


25.The average heights of three groups of students are 150 cm, 160 cm, and 140 cm, respectively, with 50 students in each group. What is the average height of all the students?


Options:
A. 145 cm
B. 150 cm
C. 155 cm
D. 160 cm

Answer: B. 150 cm


Solution:
The total height of the first group of 50 students is 50 * 150 = 7500 cm.
The total height of the second group of 50 students is 50 * 160 = 8000 cm.
The total height of the third group of 50 students is 50 * 140 = 7000 cm.
The total height of all the students is 7500 + 8000 + 7000 = 22500 cm.
The total number of students is 50 + 50 + 50 = 150.
The average height of all the students is 22500/150 = 150 cm.


26.A store has 60 books. The average price of 25 of them is Rs. 200, and that of another 30 is Rs. 250. Find the average price of the remaining books.

Options:
A. Rs. 2200
B. Rs. 2330
C. Rs. 2880
D. Rs. 2600

Answer: C.Rs. 2880


Solution:
The total price of 25 books with an average price of Rs. 200 is 25 * 200 = Rs. 5000.
The total price of another 30 books with an average price of Rs. 250 is 30 * 250 = Rs. 7500.
The total price of the remaining 5 books is Rs. (60 * 240) - 5000 - 7500 = Rs. 14400.
So, the average price of the remaining 5 books is Rs. 14400/5 = Rs. 2880.


27.The difference between two consecutive odd integers is 6. The average of these two integers is 17. What is the value of the larger odd integer?


Options:
A. 21
B. 23
C. 25
D. 27

Answer: B. 23


Solution:
Let's assume the two consecutive odd integers are x and y, where x is greater than y.
So, x - y = 6 and (x + y)/2 = 17.
By solving these two equations, we get x = 23 and y = 17.
Therefore, the larger odd integer is x = 23.


28. Mr. Manmohan calculated the average of 10 'three digit numbers'. But due to mistake, he reversed the digits of a number and thus his average increased by 19.8. The difference between the unit digit and hundreds digit of that number is :


Options:
A.8
B.4
C.2
D.can't be determined

Answer: C.2


Solution
The correct option is C 2
Remember abc−cba99(a−c),where abc and cba are the three digit numbers and (a, c)≠ 0
(First number = 100a + 10b + c; Second number = 100c + 10b + a.
So First number - Second number = 99a - 99b = 99(a-b))
Again since the difference in average = 19.8
Therefore the difference in total = 19.8 × 10 = 198
Thus, 99 × (a - c) = 198
(a - c) = 2.


29. A train travels from Station A to Station B at a speed of 60 km per hour and returns from Station B to Station A at a speed of 90 km per hour. If the total distance between the two stations is 180 km, what is the average speed of the train for the entire journey in km per hour?


Options:
A. 72
B. 36
C. 80
D. 85

Answer: B. 36


Solution:
Average speed is given by the formula: Total distance / Total time.
Total distance = 180 km (round trip).
Time taken for the journey from A to B = 180 km / 60 km/h = 3 hours.
Time taken for the return journey from B to A = 180 km / 90 km/h = 2 hours.
Total time for the round trip = 3 hours + 2 hours = 5 hours.
Average speed = 180 km / 5 hours = 36 km/h .


30.In a supermarket, the average weight of the first 40 fruits is 150 grams, while the average weight of the remaining 10 fruits is 200 grams. What is the average weight of all the fruits in the supermarket?


Options:
A. 160 grams
B. 165 grams
C. 170 grams
D. 175 grams

Answer: A. 160 grams


Solution:
Let's assume the total weight of the first 40 fruits is 40 grams, and the total weight of the remaining 10 fruits is 10 grams.
The average weight of the first 40 fruits is 150 grams, so 40x/40 = 150, and x = 150.
The average weight of the remaining 10 fruits is 200 grams, so 10y/10 = 200, and y = 200.
The total weight of all the fruits in the supermarket is 40x + 10y = 40(150) + 10(200) = 6000 + 2000 = 8000 grams.
The average weight of all the fruits is 8000 grams / 50 fruits = 160 grams.
