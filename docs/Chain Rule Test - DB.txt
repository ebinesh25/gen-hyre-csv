1. If 2 mat-weavers can weave 3 mats in 3 days, how many mats would be woven by 6 mat-weavers in 3 days?
Options:
A. 4
B. 8
C. 12
D. 9
Answer: D. 9
Solution:
Given:
2 mat-weavers weave 3 mats in 3 days
Find: Mats woven by 6 mat-weavers in 3 days
Method 1: Using Direct Proportion
Let the required number of mats be x.
The relationships are:
More weavers → More mats (Direct Proportion)
Same days → Same proportion maintained
Setting up the proportion: (Weavers₁ × Days₁ × Mats₂) = (Weavers₂ × Days₂ × Mats₁)
2 × 3 × x = 6 × 3 × 3 6x = 54 x = 9 mats
Method 2: Step-by-step reasoning
Step 1: Find productivity per weaver
2 weavers weave 3 mats in 3 days
1 weaver weaves 3/2 = 1.5 mats in 3 days
Step 2: Calculate for 6 weavers
6 weavers weave 6 × 1.5 = 9 mats in 3 days
Therefore, 6 mat-weavers would weave 9 mats in 3 days.
2. A certain number of workers can build a bridge 120 meters long, 30 meters wide, and 15 meters high in 15 days. The same number of workers can build another bridge 40 meters wide and 25 meters high in 30 days. What is the length of the second bridge?
Options:
 A. 180
B. 200
C. 108
D. 300
Answer: C. 108
Solution:
Given:
Bridge 1: Length = 120m, Width = 30m, Height = 15m, built in 15 days
Bridge 2: Width = 40m, Height = 25m, built in 30 days, Length = ?
Same number of workers
Step 1: Calculate volume of Bridge 1
Volume₁ = Length × Width × Height Volume₁ = 120 × 30 × 15 = 54,000 cubic meters
Step 2: Set up volume for Bridge 2
Let the length of Bridge 2 = L meters Volume₂ = L × 40 × 25 = 1000L cubic meters
Step 3: Apply the work principle
Since the same number of workers are involved, the work done is proportional to volume and time:
Work rate = Volume/Time
For the same work rate: Volume₁/Time₁ = Volume₂/Time₂
54,000/15 = 1000L/30
Step 4: Solve for L
Cross multiply: 54,000 × 30 = 1000L × 15 1,620,000 = 15,000L L = 1,620,000/15,000 L = 108 meters
Therefore, the length of the second bridge is 108 meters.
3. If 27 workers working 8 hours a day can build a wall in 12 days, how many workers working 6 hours a day can build it in 18 days?
Options:
 A. 12
B. 24
C. 18
D. 20
Answer: B. 24
Solution:
Given:
Group 1: 27 workers, 8 hours/day, 12 days
Group 2: x workers, 6 hours/day, 18 days
Both groups complete the same work
Step 1: Apply work formula
Total work is constant, so: (Workers₁ × Hours₁ × Days₁) = (Workers₂ × Hours₂ × Days₂)
Step 2: Set up the equation
Let x = number of workers required in the second group
27 × 8 × 12 = x × 6 × 18
Step 3: Solve for x
2,592 = 108 x x = 2,592 ÷ 108 x = 24 workers
Therefore, 24 workers working 6 hours a day can build the wall in 18 days.
4. If 30 workers can build 150 chairs in 12 hours, how many workers are needed to build 75 chairs in 9 hours?
Options:
A. 20
B. 25
C. 30
D. 35
Answer: A. 20
Solution:
Given:
30 workers build 150 chairs in 12 hours
Find: Workers needed to build 75 chairs in 9 hours
Let the required number of workers be x.
Understanding the relationships:
More chairs → More workers (Direct Proportion)
Less hours → More workers (Inverse Proportion)
Method 1: Using proportion
We can set up the equation: Workers₁ × Hours₁ × Chairs₂ = Workers₂ × Hours₂ × Chairs₁
30 × 12 × 75 = x × 9 × 150 27,000 = 1,350x x = 27,000 ÷ 1,350 x = 20 workers
Method 2: Using work rate
Work rate per worker = Chairs/(Workers × Hours) Work rate per worker = 150/(30 × 12) = 150/360 = 5/12 chairs per worker-hour
For 75 chairs in 9 hours: 75 = x × 9 × (5/12) 75 = x × 45/12 75 × 12 = 45x 900 = 45x x = 20 workers
Therefore, 20 workers are needed to build 75 chairs in 9 hours.
5. A ship with 250 passengers had food for 30 days. After 10 days, 50 more passengers boarded the ship. For how many more days will the remaining food last now?
Options:
A. 15
B. 16
C. 17
D. 18
Answer: B. 16
Solution:
Given:
Initial passengers = 250
Initial food supply = 30 days
After 10 days, 50 more passengers board
Find: Days remaining food will last
Step 1: Calculate remaining food
Food consumed = 10 days (for 250 passengers) 
Remaining food = Food for 250 passengers for (30 - 10) = 20 days
Step 2: Calculate new total passengers
New total passengers = 250 + 50 = 300 passengers
Step 3: Apply inverse proportion
Let x = number of days remaining food will last for 300 passengers
Since food amount is constant: (Passengers₁ × Days₁) = (Passengers₂ × Days₂)
250 × 20 = 300 × x 5,000 = 300x x = 5,000 ÷ 300 x = 16.67 days ≈ 16 days (rounded down)
Therefore, the remaining food will last for approximately 16 more days.
6. A small propeller with 6 blades is mounted with a larger propeller with 14 blades. If the smaller propeller completes 84 rotations, how many rotations will the larger propeller complete?
Options:
 A. 20
B. 40
C. 36
D. 80
Answer: C. 36
Solution:
Given:
Small propeller has 6 blades
Large propeller has 14 blades
Small propeller completes 84 rotations
Find: Rotations completed by large propeller
Understanding the mechanism:
When two propellers are mounted together (geared or connected), the total number of blade passages must be equal. This creates an inverse relationship between the number of blades and the number of rotations.
Step 1: Set up the relationship
(Blades on small) × (Rotations of small) = (Blades on large) × (Rotations of large)
Let x = rotations of large propeller
6 × 84 = 14 × x
Step 2: Solve for x
504 = 14x x = 504 ÷ 14 x = 36 rotations
Therefore, the larger propeller will complete 36 rotations.
7. A basket has fruits enough for 90 guests or 120 children. If 80 children have already eaten fruits, how many guests can still have fruits with the remaining quantity?
Options:
A. 20
B. 30
C. 40
D. 45
Answer: B. 30
Solution:
Given:
Total fruits can feed 90 guests OR 120 children
80 children have already eaten
Find: Number of guests that can be fed with remaining fruits
Step 1: Calculate fraction of fruits consumed
If total fruits can feed 120 children, and 80 children have eaten: Fraction consumed = 80/120 = 2/3 of total fruits
Step 2: Calculate remaining fruits
Remaining fruits = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 of total fruits
Step 3: Calculate number of guests that can be fed
If total fruits can feed 90 guests, then 1/3 of fruits can feed: Number of guests = (1/3) × 90 = 30 guests
Therefore, 30 guests can still have fruits with the remaining quantity.
8. It takes a certain number of workers to assemble a car in 20 days. If the team size is decreased by 15, it would take 10 days longer to complete the assembly. How many workers were originally part of the team?
Options:
A. 45
B. 70
C. 90
D. 100
Answer: A. 45
Solution:
Given:
Original workers complete assembly in 20 days
With 15 fewer workers, it takes 10 days longer (20 + 10 = 30 days)
Find: Original number of workers
Let x = original number of workers
Step 1: Apply the work formula
Since the total work is the same: (Workers₁ × Time₁) = (Workers₂ × Time₂)
Original situation: x workers × 20 days New situation: (x - 15) workers × 30 days
Step 2: Set up the equation
x × 20 = (x - 15) × 30
Step 3: Solve for x
20x = 30x - 450 20x - 30x = -450 -10x = -450 x = 450 ÷ 10 x = 45 workers
Therefore, 45 workers were originally part of the team.

9. A construction crew undertook to build a certain structure in 30 days. They employed a certain number of workers, but 20 of them were absent from the very 1st day. The rest could finish the structure in 60 days. Find the number of workers originally employed.


Options:
A. 40
B. 50
C. 60
D. 70

Answer: A. 40


Solution:
Let there be x workers at the beginning. Less workers, more days.
So, 60:30:x:(x-20)
60*(x-20) = 30x
60x - 1200 = 30x
30x = 1200
x = 40
Therefore, the originally employed workers were 40.
10. A construction project is scheduled to be completed in 30 days. The contractor begins with a team of 80 workers and adds 80 more workers after 20 days. If the additional workers were not hired, how many days behind schedule would the project be completed?
 Options:
 A. 5
B. 6
C. 7
D. 10
Answer: D. 10
Solution:
Step 1: Calculate total work in the actual scenario
First 20 days: 80 workers work
Remaining 10 days: 160 workers (80 + 80) work
Total work = (80 × 20) + (160 × 10) = 1600 + 1600 = 3200 worker-days
Step 2: Calculate time needed with only 80 workers
Total work required = 3200 worker-days
With only 80 workers throughout: Time = 3200 ÷ 80 = 40 days
Step 3: Calculate delay behind schedule
Scheduled completion time = 30 days
Actual time with only 80 workers = 40 days
Days behind schedule = 40 - 30 = 10 days
Therefore, without hiring additional workers, the project would be completed 10 days behind schedule.


11.A bakery owner planned to bake 200 cakes in 30 days with a team of 15 bakers. After 20 days, it was discovered that only 25% of the cakes had been baked. How many extra days beyond the scheduled time are needed to complete all the cakes?


Options:
A. 12
B. 15
C. 50
D. 20
Answer: C. 50


Solution:
25% work done in 20 days.
1% work done in = 20/25
100% work done = (20 * 100)/25 = 80 days.
So, extra days required = 80 - 30 = 50 days.
12. A software project is scheduled to be finished in 90 days with a team of 60 developers. After 45 days, only 40% of the project has been completed. How many more developers should be hired after 45 days to meet the deadline?
Options:
 A. 90
B. 25
C. 75
D. 30
Answer: D. 30
Solution:
Given:
Total project duration = 90 days
Original team = 60 developers
After 45 days: 40% completed
Find: Additional developers needed
Step 1: Analyze work completed and remaining
Time elapsed = 45 days
Work completed = 40%
Work remaining = 100% - 40% = 60%
Time remaining = 90 - 45 = 45 days
Step 2: Calculate total work in developer-days
Work done = 60 developers × 45 days = 2,700 developer-days
If 2,700 developer-days = 40% of work Then total work = 2,700 ÷ 0.40 = 6,750 developer-days
Step 3: Calculate remaining work
Remaining work = 60% of 6,750 = 0.60 × 6,750 = 4,050 developer-days
Step 4: Calculate developers needed for remaining work
Time available = 45 days Developers needed = Remaining work ÷ Time available Developers needed = 4,050 ÷ 45 = 90 developers
Step 5: Calculate additional developers to hire
Additional developers = Developers needed - Current developers Additional developers = 90 - 60 = 30 developers
Therefore, 30 more developers should be hired to meet the deadline.
13. A software development project was planned to take 90 days to complete with a team of 50 developers. After 30 days, only 20% of the work had been completed. If the amount of work is increased by 20% of the original work, how many extra days are required (in comparison with the scheduled time) with the number of developers remaining constant?
Options:
 A. 100
B. 75
C. 90
D. 80
Answer: C. 90
Solution:
Given:
Original schedule: 90 days, 50 developers
After 30 days: 20% work completed
Work increased by 20% of original
Developers remain constant at 50
Step 1: Calculate total original work
In 30 days, 50 developers completed 20% of work. Work done = 50 × 30 = 1,500 developer-days = 20% of original work
Total original work = 1,500 ÷ 0.20 = 7,500 developer-days
Step 2: Calculate new total work after increase
Work increase = 20% of original = 0.20 × 7,500 = 1,500 developer-days New total work = 7,500 + 1,500 = 9,000 developer-days
Step 3: Calculate remaining work after 30 days
Work completed = 1,500 developer-days Remaining work = 9,000 - 1,500 = 7,500 developer-days
Step 4: Calculate days needed for remaining work
With 50 developers: Days needed = 7,500 ÷ 50 = 150 days
Step 5: Calculate total time and extra days
Total time required = 30 days (elapsed) + 150 days (remaining) = 180 days Extra days beyond schedule = 180 - 90 = 90 days
Therefore, 90 extra days are required beyond the scheduled time.


14. A factory production run was planned to be completed in 120 days with a team of 60 workers. After 40 days, it was found that only 30% of the work had been completed. How many more workers should be added to complete the work 40 days ahead of schedule?
Options:
A. 120
B. 80
C. 100
D. 150
Answer: B. 80
Explanation: 
The work completed in 40 days = 30%, so remaining work = 70%. 
With the original schedule, 80 days remain, but the target is to finish 40 days early, leaving only 40 days. 
In 40 days, 60 workers completed 30% work (2400 worker-days). 
For 70% work, we need (70/30) × 2400 = 5600 worker-days. 
To complete this in 40 days requires 5600 ÷ 40 = 140 workers. 
Therefore, additional workers needed = 140 - 60 = 80 workers.
15. 8 men or 12 women can complete a task in 12 days. How many women are needed to complete the task in 9 days?
Options:
 A. 15
B. 20
C. 16
D. 30
Answer: C. 16
Explanation :
Step 1: Find total work
12 women complete the task in 12 days
Total work = 12 × 12 = 144 woman-days
Step 2: Calculate women needed for 9 days
Work to be done = 144 woman-days
Time available = 9 days
Women required = 144 ÷ 9 = 16 women
Therefore, 16 women are needed to complete the task in 9 days.
16. If 3 printers consume 5 reams of paper when each is running for 10 hours a day, how many reams of paper will be needed for 9 printers, each running for 6 hours a day, it being given that 2 printers of the former type consume as much as 3 printers of the latter type?
 Options:
A. 6
B. 10
C. 12
D. 15
Answer: A. 6
Explanation:
Step 1: Find consumption rate of the first type of printer
3 printers running 10 hours each = 30 printer-hours consume 5 reams
Rate of first type = 5/30 = 1/6 ream per printer-hour
Step 2: Find consumption rate of the second type
2 printers of first type = 3 printers of second type (in consumption)
2 printers of first type consume: 2 × 1/6 = 1/3 ream per hour
Therefore, 3 printers of second type consume 1/3 ream per hour
1 printer of second type consumes: (1/3)/3 = 1/9 ream per hour
Step 3: Calculate reams for 9 second-type printers running 6 hours
Total printer-hours = 9 × 6 = 54 printer-hours
Reams needed = 54 × 1/9 = 6 reams
Therefore, 6 reams of paper will be needed.
17. If 12 painters and 18 laborers can paint a house in 5 days, and 36 painters and 30 laborers can paint the same house in 2 days, how long will it take for 4 painters and 14 laborers to paint a similar house?
 Options:
A. 30 days
B. 40 days
C. 20 days
D. 10 days
Answer: D. 10 days
Explanation :
Step 1: Set up equations with work rates
Let p = 1 painter's 1-day work, l = 1 laborer's 1-day work
From condition 1: (12p + 18l) × 5 = Total work → 60p + 90l = W
From condition 2: (36p + 30l) × 2 = Total work → 72p + 60l = W
Step 2: Solve for relationship between painter and laborer
Equating: 60p + 90l = 72p + 60l
Simplifying: 30l = 12p
Therefore: p = 2.5l (1 painter does 2.5 times the work of 1 laborer)
Step 3: Calculate total work
Substitute p = 2.5l into first equation: 60(2.5l) + 90l = W
Total work W = 150l + 90l = 240l
Step 4: Find time for 4 painters and 14 laborers
Combined daily work = 4p + 14l = 4(2.5l) + 14l = 10l + 14l = 24l
Time required = 240l ÷ 24l = 10 days
Therefore, it will take 10 days for 4 painters and 14 laborers to paint the house.
18. 2 doctors and 3 nurses earn Rs. 7000 in 2 days. 1 doctor and 2 nurses earn Rs. 8000 in 4 days. In how many days can 3 doctors and 3 nurses earn Rs. 18000?
Options:
A. 3 days
B. 4 days
C. 5 days
D. 6 days
Answer: B. 4 days
Explanation :
Step 1: Set up equations for daily earnings
Let d = 1 doctor's daily earnings, n = 1 nurse's daily earnings
From condition 1: (2d + 3n) × 2 = 7000 → 2d + 3n = 3500
From condition 2: (1d + 2n) × 4 = 8000 → d + 2n = 2000
Step 2: Solve for individual daily earnings
From second equation: d = 2000 - 2n
Substitute into first equation: 2(2000 - 2n) + 3n = 3500
Simplifying: 4000 - 4n + 3n = 3500 → n = 500
Therefore: d = 2000 - 2(500) = 1000
Step 3: Verify the solution
Check: 2(1000) + 3(500) = 3500 
Check: 1000 + 2(500) = 2000 
Step 4: Calculate time for 3 doctors and 3 nurses
Combined daily earnings = 3(1000) + 3(500) = 4500
Days required = 18000 ÷ 4500 = 4 days
Therefore, 3 doctors and 3 nurses will earn Rs. 18000 in 4 days.
19. If 3 men and 4 boys can complete a task in 12 days, and 4 men and 3 boys can complete it in 10 days, how long will 2 men and 5 boys take to complete it?
Options:
 A. 12 days
B. 10 days
C. 15 days
D. 16 days
Answer: C. 15 days
Explanation :
Step 1: Set up equations with work rates
Let m = 1 man's 1-day work, b = 1 boy's 1-day work
From condition 1: (3m + 4b) × 12 = Total work → 36m + 48b = W
From condition 2: (4m + 3b) × 10 = Total work → 40m + 30b = W
Step 2: Solve for relationship between man and boy
Equating: 36m + 48b = 40m + 30b
Simplifying: 18b = 4m
Therefore: m = 4.5b (1 man does 4.5 times the work of 1 boy)
Step 3: Calculate total work
Substitute m = 4.5b into first equation: 36(4.5b) + 48b = W
Total work W = 162b + 48b = 210b
Step 4: Find time for 2 men and 5 boys
Combined daily work = 2m + 5b = 2(4.5b) + 5b = 9b + 5b = 14b
Time required = 210b ÷ 14b = 15 days
Therefore, 2 men and 5 boys will take 15 days to complete the task.
