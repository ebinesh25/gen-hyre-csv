1. A team of four workers can build a house in 70 days. If the efficiency of the team increases by 40%, how many days will it take them to build the same house?
A. 45
 B. 48
 C. 50
 D. 55
Answer: C. 50 days
Solution (Line by Line):
Step 1: Calculate total work required
* Total work = 4 workers × 70 days = 280 worker-days
Step 2: Determine new efficiency
* Original efficiency = 100%
* Efficiency increases by 40%
* New efficiency = 100% + 40% = 140% = 1.40 times the original
Step 3: Calculate new time with increased efficiency
* When efficiency increases by 40%, work is done 1.40 times faster
* New time = Original time ÷ 1.40 = 70 ÷ 1.40 = 50 days
Step 4: Verification
* Work at new efficiency: 4 workers × 1.40 × 50 days = 280 worker-days ✓
Therefore, with a 40% increase in efficiency, the team will take 50 days to build the same house.




2. D can finish a work in 40 days. E can finish the work in 20 days, and F can finish the work in 10 days. D and E start the work but are forced to leave after 4 days. The remaining work was done by F in:
A. 5 days
 B. 6 days
 C. 7 days
 D. 8 days
Answer: C. 7 days
Solution (Line by Line):
Step 1: Calculate individual work rates
* D's 1-day work = 1/40 of the total work
* E's 1-day work = 1/20 of the total work
* F's 1-day work = 1/10 of the total work
Step 2: Calculate work done by D and E together in 4 days
* Combined work rate of D and E = 1/40 + 1/20 = 1/40 + 2/40 = 3/40
* Work completed in 4 days = 4 × 3/40 = 12/40 = 3/10
Step 3: Calculate remaining work
* Total work = 1 (whole work)
* Work already completed = 3/10
* Remaining work = 1 - 3/10 = 7/10
Step 4: Calculate time for F to complete remaining work
* F completes 1/10 of work per day
* Time required = (7/10) ÷ (1/10) = 7 days
Therefore, F will complete the remaining work in 7 days.




3. Maya and Ethan can do a piece of work in 12 days and 30 days respectively. If they work for a day, alternatively, Maya beginning, in how many days will the work be completed?
A. 16 days
 B. 16 4/5 days
 C. 17 1/7 days
 D. 22 days
Answer: B. 16 4/5 days
Solution (Line by Line):
Step 1: Calculate individual work rates
* Maya's 1-day work = 1/12
* Ethan's 1-day work = 1/30
Step 2: Calculate work done in one 2-day cycle
* Day 1 (Maya works): 1/12
* Day 2 (Ethan works): 1/30
* Total in 2 days = 1/12 + 1/30 = 5/60 + 2/60 = 7/60
Step 3: Find number of complete cycles
* Work per cycle = 7/60
* After 8 complete cycles (16 days): 8 × 7/60 = 56/60 = 14/15
* Remaining work = 1 - 14/15 = 1/15
Step 4: Calculate time for remaining work on day 17
* Day 17 is Maya's turn (she begins the cycle)
* Time for Maya to complete 1/15 work = (1/15) ÷ (1/12) = 12/15 = 4/5 day
Step 5: Calculate total time
* Total time = 16 days + 4/5 day = 16 4/5 days
Therefore, the work will be completed in 16 4/5 days.




4. A can do a work in 21 days. B is 40% more efficient than A. In how many days will B complete the work?
A. 13 days
 B. 15 days
 C. 17 days
 D. 19 days
Answer: B. 15 days
Solution (Line by Line):
Step 1: Calculate A's work rate
* A completes the work in 21 days
* A's 1-day work = 1/21
Step 2: Determine B's efficiency
* B is 40% more efficient than A
* B's efficiency = 100% + 40% = 140% of A's efficiency = 1.40 times A's rate
Step 3: Calculate B's work rate
* B's 1-day work = 1.40 × (1/21) = 1.40/21 = 1/15
Step 4: Calculate days for B to complete the work
* Time for B = 1 ÷ (1/15) = 15 days
Alternative approach:
* When efficiency increases by 40%, time decreases proportionally
* Time for B = 21 ÷ 1.40 = 15 days
Therefore, B will complete the work in 15 days.




5. A, B, and C can do work in 20, 12, and 15 days respectively. In approximately how many days can B complete the work if A and C help him every third day?
A. 8 days
 B. 9 days
 C. 10 days
 D. 8 1/2 days
Answer: D. 8 1/2 days

Step 1: Calculate individual work rates
* A's 1-day work = 1/20
* B's 1-day work = 1/12
* C's 1-day work = 1/15
Step 2: Understand the work pattern
* Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, etc.: B works alone
* Days 3, 6, 9, etc.: A, B, and C work together
Step 3: Calculate work in one 3-day cycle
* Days 1-2 (B alone): 2 × 1/12 = 1/6
* Day 3 (A+B+C): 1/20 + 1/12 + 1/15 = 3/60 + 5/60 + 4/60 = 12/60 = 1/5
* Total work per cycle = 1/6 + 1/5 = 5/30 + 6/30 = 11/30
Step 4: Calculate work after complete cycles
* After 2 cycles (6 days): 2 × 11/30 = 22/30 = 11/15
* Remaining work = 1 - 11/15 = 4/15
Step 5: Complete remaining work
* Day 7 (B alone): 1/12, remaining = 4/15 - 1/12 = 16/60 - 5/60 = 11/60
* Day 8 (B alone): 1/12, remaining = 11/60 - 5/60 = 6/60 = 1/10
* Day 9 (A+B+C): Time for 1/10 work = (1/10) ÷ (1/5) = 1/2 day
Step 6: Total time
* Total = 8 + 1/2 = 8 1/2 days
Therefore, the work will be completed in approximately 8 1/2 days.

 C. 100 days
 D. 80 days
Answer: D. 80 days
Solution (Line by Line):
Step 1: Calculate individual work rates
* Suhan's 1-day work = 1/20
* Simran's 1-day work = 1/16
* Let Rahul's 1-day work = 1/R
Step 2: Set up equation for combined work
* All three together complete the work in 8 days
* Combined 1-day work = 1/8

Step 3: Solve for Rahul's work rate
* 1/R = 1/8 - 1/20 - 1/16
* Converting to common denominator (LCM = 80):
* 1/R = 10/80 - 4/80 - 5/80 = 1/80
* Therefore: R = 80 days
Step 4: Verification
* Combined rate: 1/20 + 1/16 + 1/80 = 4/80 + 5/80 + 1/80 = 10/80 = 1/8 ✓
Therefore, Rahul alone can complete the job in 80 days.

Step 1: Set up the relationship
* P is 3 times as efficient as Q
* If Q takes x days, then P takes x/3 days
* Given: x - x/3 = 40
Step 2: Solve for individual times
* x - x/3 = 40
* 2x/3 = 40
* x = 60 days (Q's time)
* P's time = 60/3 = 20 days
Step 3: Calculate individual work rates
* P's 1-day work = 1/20
* Q's 1-day work = 1/60
Step 4: Calculate combined work rate

Step 1: Calculate individual work rates
* M's 1-day work = 1/8
* N's 1-day work = 1/12
Step 2: Calculate combined work rate and work done in 3 days
* Combined 1-day work = 1/8 + 1/12 = 3/24 + 2/24 = 5/24
* Work completed in 3 days = 3 × 5/24 = 15/24 = 5/8
Step 3: Calculate remaining work after N leaves
* Total work = 1 (complete room)
* Work completed = 5/8
* Remaining work = 1 - 5/8 = 3/8
Step 4: Calculate time for M to complete remaining work
* M completes 1/8 of work per day
* Time required = (3/8) ÷ (1/8) = 3 days
Therefore, M will finish the remaining work in 3 days.
10. On a certain day, Ram works at 9/5th of his usual rate of doing work and finishes the work 20 minutes earlier than the usual time required. Had Ram worked at 5/9th of his usual rate of doing work then the time taken by him to complete the work would have been how much more than the usual time required?
A. 30 minutes
 B. 36 minutes
 C. 40 minutes
 D. 45 minutes
Answer: B. 36 minutes
Solution (Line by Line):
Step 1: Set up the relationship with usual time
* Let usual time = T minutes
* When rate increases to 9/5, time becomes proportionally less
* New time = T × (5/9) = 5T/9
Step 2: Calculate time saved and find usual time
* Time saved = T - 5T/9 = 4T/9 = 20 minutes (given)
* Solving: 4T/9 = 20
* T = 20 × 9/4 = 45 minutes (usual time)
Step 3: Calculate time at 5/9 rate
* When rate becomes 5/9, time becomes proportionally more
* New time = 45 × (9/5) = 81 minutes
Step 4: Calculate extra time required
* Extra time = 81 - 45 = 36 minutes
Therefore, Ram would take 36 minutes more than the usual time required.




11. D and E can do a work in 9 days, E and F can do the same work in 12 days, and F and D can do the same work in 18 days. D, E, and F will complete the work together in how many days?
A. 6 days
 B. 8 days
 C. 10 days
 D. 12 days
Answer: B. 8 days
Solution (Line by Line):
Step 1: Set up equations for combined work rates
* Let d, e, f = 1-day work of D, E, F respectively
* D + E complete in 9 days: d + e = 1/9
* E + F complete in 12 days: e + f = 1/12
* F + D complete in 18 days: f + d = 1/18
Step 2: Add all three equations
* (d + e) + (e + f) + (f + d) = 1/9 + 1/12 + 1/18
* 2(d + e + f) = 1/9 + 1/12 + 1/18
Step 3: Calculate the sum (LCM of 9, 12, 18 = 36)
* 2(d + e + f) = 4/36 + 3/36 + 2/36 = 9/36 = 1/4
Step 4: Find combined work rate of D, E, and F
* d + e + f = 1/4 ÷ 2 = 1/8
Step 5: Calculate time for all three together
* If combined 1-day work = 1/8
* Time required = 1 ÷ (1/8) = 8 days
Therefore, D, E, and F working together will complete the work in 8 days.




12. Worker X can complete a project in the same time as worker Y and Z together can do it. If X and Y together complete the project in 10 days and Z completes it in 30 days, how long would it take X to complete the project alone?
Options: 
A. 50 days 
B. 25 days 
C. 15 days 
D. 65 days
Answer: C. 15 days
Explanation:
Step 1: Set up equations from given information 
Let work rates be: 1/x, 1/y, 1/z for workers X, Y, Z respectively (where x, y, z are days to complete alone) 
Given: X's rate = Y's rate + Z's rate → 1/x = 1/y + 1/z ... (1) 
Given: X and Y together complete in 10 days → 1/x + 1/y = 1/10 ... (2) 
Given: Z completes in 30 days → z = 30, so 1/z = 1/30 ... (3)
Step 2: Substitute equation (3) into equation (1) 1/x = 1/y + 1/30
Step 3: Rearrange to express 1/y in terms of 1/x 1/y = 1/x - 1/30
Step 4: Substitute this expression into equation (2) 1/x + (1/x - 1/30) = 1/10 2/x - 1/30 = 1/10
Step 5: Solve for x 2/x = 1/10 + 1/30 2/x = 3/30 + 1/30 2/x = 4/30 2/x = 2/15 x = 15 days
Step 6: Verification If x = 15: 1/x = 1/15 From equation (1): 1/15 = 1/y + 1/30 → 1/y = 1/15 - 1/30 = 2/30 - 1/30 = 1/30, so y = 30 days Check equation (2): 1/15 + 1/30 = 2/30 + 1/30 = 3/30 = 1/10 
Therefore, worker X would take 15 days to complete the project alone.

A. 10 days
 B. 12 days
 C. 14 days
 D. 16 days
Answer: B. 12 days
Solution (Line by Line):
Step 1: Identify work rates
* A's individual rate = 1/21 per day
* B's individual rate = 1/28 per day
* Combined rate of A and B = 1/T per day
Step 2: Set up the equation
* 1/21 + 1/28 = 1/T
Step 3: Find common denominator (LCM of 21 and 28 = 84)
* 4/84 + 3/84 = 1/T
* 7/84 = 1/T
* 1/12 = 1/T
Step 4: Solve for T
* T = 12 days
Step 5: Verification
* Check: 1/21 + 1/28 = 4/84 + 3/84 = 7/84 = 1/12 ✓
* Therefore T = 12 days is correct
Therefore, painters A and B together can paint the room in T = 12 days.

A. 10 days
 B. 12 days
 C. 14 days
 D. 16 days
Answer: B. 12 days
Solution (Line by Line):
Step 1: Set up efficiency relationship
* Let Kavi's work rate = k per day
* Maya is twice as efficient: Maya's rate = 2k per day
Step 2: Use combined work information
* Together they complete in 8 days
* Combined 1-day work = 1/8
* Equation: 2k + k = 1/8
Step 3: Solve for individual rates
* 3k = 1/8
* k = 1/24 (Kavi's rate)
* Maya's rate = 2k = 2/24 = 1/12
Step 4: Calculate Maya's time alone
* If Maya completes 1/12 of work per day
* Time for complete work = 1 ÷ (1/12) = 12 days
Therefore, Maya alone would take 12 days to paint the house.

* S's 1-day work = 1/20
* T's 1-day work = 1/30
* U's 1-day work = 1/60
Step 2: Set up work timeline
* Let total days = d
* S works for (d - 5) days
* T works for (d - 3) days
* U works for d days
Step 3: Write equation
* (d - 5)/20 + (d - 3)/30 + d/60 = 1
Step 4: Solve (LCM = 60)
* 3(d - 5) + 2(d - 3) + d = 60
* 3d - 15 + 2d - 6 + d = 60
* 6d - 21 = 60
* 6d = 81
* d = 13.5 days
Therefore, the work was completed in 13.5 days.
