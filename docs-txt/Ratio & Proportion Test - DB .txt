3.A sum of money is divided among P,Q,R and S in the ratio 5:4:7:9 respectively.If the share of P is Rs.2300 more than that of Q, then what is R’s share? 

Options:
A.Rs.20700
B.Rs.16000 
C.Rs.16100
D.Rs.9200 

Answer : C.Rs.16100


Solution:
Given: 
Ratio of the share of P, Q, R, and S = 5:4:7:9 
Let the common ratio be x 
So, P's share = 5x, Q's share = 4x, R's share = 7x, S's share = 9x 
Also, P's share = Q's share + 2300 
To find: Total amount of R and S together 
Let's first find the value of x 
5x = 4x + 2300 
x = 2300 
So, P's share = 5x = 5*2300 = Rs.11500 
Q's share = 4x = 4*2300 = Rs.9200 
R's share = 7x = 7*2300 = Rs.16100 
S's share = 9x = 9*2300 = Rs.20700 


4.A school has students in the ratio 2 : 3 : 4 in the 9th, 10th, and 11th grades. If the school decides to increase the number of students in each grade by 25%, 30%, and 35%, respectively, what will be the new ratio of students in these grades? 

Options:
A.25:54:39
B.25:39:54
C.14:13:27
D.26:13:54

Answer : B.25:39:54


Solution:
Let's represent the initial number of students in the 9th, 10th, and 11th grades as 2x, 3x, and 4x, respectively, where x is a positive integer.
Increase of 25% in the 9th-grade students:
New number of 9th-grade students = 2x + 0.25 * 2x = 2x + 0.5x = 2.5x
Increase of 30% in the 10th-grade students:
New number of 10th-grade students = 3x + 0.30 * 3x = 3x + 0.9x = 3.9x
Increase of 35% in the 11th-grade students:
New number of 11th-grade students = 4x + 0.35 * 4x = 4x + 1.4x = 5.4x
Now, let's find the ratio of the increased students:
The ratio of increased students in the 9th, 10th, and 11th grades is 2.5x : 3.9x : 5.4x.
We can simplify this ratio by dividing each term by the greatest common factor, which is x:
2.5x : 3.9x : 5.4x = 2.5 : 3.9 : 5.4
To make the ratio more straightforward, we can scale it up by multiplying all terms by a common factor to eliminate decimals. Let's multiply by 10 to get whole numbers:
(2.5 * 10) : (3.9 * 10) : (5.4 * 10) = 25 : 39 : 54
So, the new ratio of students in the 9th, 10th, and 11th grades after the increase is 25 : 39 : 54.

Apple = (2/5) x 25 = 10 liters; orange = (3/5) x 25 = 15 liters
Calculation:
Let x amount of orange should be added in the juice.
∴{10/(15+x)}=1/2
2(10) = 1(15 + x)
20 = 15 + x
x = 5 liters

A: B : C = A x B2: B1 x B2: B2 x C
Calculation:
Let the first, second and third numbers be A,B and C respectively.
A+ B + C = 136
A:B =2:3
B:C= 5:3
A:B:C= 10:15:9
A + B + C = lOx + 15x+ 9x
A + B + C = 34x
34x = 136
x = 4
B = 15x
B = 60
∴The second number is 60.

C. 207
D. 217

Answer : C. 207

Solution:
The given ratio is
1/2 : 2/3 : 3/4
Take LCM of denominators (2, 3, 4) = 12
Convert the ratio into whole numbers:
(1/2) × 12 = 6
(2/3) × 12 = 8
(3/4) × 12 = 9
So, the ratio becomes:
6 : 8 : 9
Sum of the ratio parts = 6 + 8 + 9 = 23
Total value = 529
Value of one part = 529 / 23 = 23
Third part = 9 × 23 = 207
Answer: 207


8.Two numbers are in the ratio of 4: 7. If 12 is subtracted from each, then the new ratio becomes 14 : 29. The smaller number is:

Options:
A.70
B.40
C.140
D.None of the above

Answer : B.40


Solution:
Let the two number be a and b respectively.
Given,
Two numbers are in the ratio of 4 : 7.
a:b=4:7
a/b = 4/ 7
a = 4b/7
Given,
If 12 be subtracted from each, then the new ratio becomes 14: 29.
(a- 12):(b- 12)= 14:29
(a - 12)/(b - 12) = 14/29
(4b/7 - 12)/(b - 12) = 14/29
(4h - 84)/7(b -12) = 14/29
(4h-84) x 29 = 14 x 7(b - 12)
4(b -21) x 29 = 98(b -12)
58(b -21) = 49(b - 12)
58b - 1218 = 49b -588
9b= 630
b = 70
a = (4 X 70)/17
a = 40
The two numbers are 40 and 70 respectively.

B.Rs. 26000,Rs.24000
C.Rs. 20000,Rs.26000
D.Rs. 22500,Rs.24000

Answer : B.Rs. 26000,Rs.24000


Solution:
Given:
Total amount = Rs. 56000
And A: B = 4: 3, B : C = 1: 3, C: D = 3 : 4
Calculation:
According to question,
A/B=4/3,B/C=1/3,C/D=3/4
A/B=4/3*1/1,B/C=⅓*3/3,C/D=¾*3/3
A/B=4/3,B/C=3/9,C/D=9/12
So, A: B : C: D = 4: 3 : 9: 12
Let the ratio be x
So, the amount received by A = 4x
The amount received by B = 3x
The amount received by C = 9x
And the amount received by D = 12x
So, according to question,
4x + 3x + 9x + 12x = 56000
28x = 56000
x = 2000
So, the amount received by A = 4x2000 =  Rs. 8000
the amount received by B = 3 x 2000 = Rs. 6000
And the amount received by C = 9 x 2000 = Rs. 18000
So, the total amount received by A and C together = 8000 + 18000 = Rs.26000
the total amount received by B and C together = 6000 + 18000 = Rs.24000.

B.Rs. 57420
C.Rs. 74250
D.Rs. 47520

Answer : A.Rs. 64800


Solution:
Given:
A diamond is broken into three parts in the ratio 1: 2 : 3
Loss after broken = Rs. 39600
Concept:
In this type of questions we can calculate the actual weight of diamond by adding all the ratios.
Calculation:
Let the weight of 3 parts be x, 2x, and 3x
So actual weight of diamond = x + 2x + 3x = 6x
According to question
The price of diamond is in proportion to square of its weight
The price of diamond before broken = (6x)^2
= 36x^2
The price of diamond after broken = x^2 + (2x)^2 + (3x)^2
x^2 + 4x + 9x^2
= 14x^2
Loss after broken = 36x^2—14x^2
39600 = 22x^2
x^2= 1800
The price of diamond before broken = 36x^2
= 36 x 1800
64800
:. The price of diamond before broken is Rs. 64800.


12.The annual incomes of A and B are in the ratio 3 : 4 and their annual expenditures are in the ratio 5 : 7. If each saves Rs. 5, 000 then, find their annual incomes.

Options:
A = Rs. 22,000 and B = Rs. 30,000
A = Rs. 30,000 and B = Rs. 40,000
A = Rs. 50,000 and B = Rs. 70,000
A = Rs. 40,000 and B = Rs. 20,000

Answer : A = Rs. 30,000 and B = Rs. 40,000


Solution:
Let the annual incomes of A and B be 3x and 4x
And the annual expenditures of A and B be 5y and 7y
Since each of them saves Rs5000. 
3x−5y=5000 ----- (1)
4x−7y=5000 ---- (2)
Multiplying equation  (1) with 4 we get, 12x−20y=20000 ----- equation (3)
Multiplying equation  (2) with 3 we get, 12x−21y=15000 ----- equation (4)
Subtracting equation (4) from (3), we get y=5000
Substituting y=5000 in the equation (1), we get 3x−5(5000)=5000=x=10000
Hence,, annual income of A =3x= Rs 30000 and of B =4x= Rs 40000.
