1. In a 300 metres race A beats B by 40 m or 8 seconds. A's time over the course is:


Options:
A. 44 sec
B. 22 sec
C. 33 sec
D. 52 sec

Answer: D. 52 sec


Solution:
B runs 40 m in 8 sec.
B covers 300 m in ( (8/40​) ×300 ​ )=60sec. 
B's time over the course = 60 sec.
A's time over the course (60-8) sec = 52 sec.


2. A can run 15 m while B runs 25 m. In a kilometre race B beats A by:


Options:
A. 160 m
B. 400 m
C. 200 m
D. 100 m

Answer:  B. 400 m


Solution:
When B runs 25 m, A runs 30/2 ​ m. 
When B runs 1000 m, A runs ( (30/2) ×(1/25)​×1000)m = 600m. 
B beats A by 400 m.
3. In a 800 m race, the ratio of the speeds of two contestants A and B is 2:1. A has a start of 240 m. Then, A wins by:
Options:
 A. 660 m
B. 540 m
C. 520 m
D. 510 m
Answer: C. 520 m
Solution :
Step 1: Understand the race setup
Total race distance = 800 m
A starts 240 m ahead (head start)
A needs to cover: 800 - 240 = 560 m
B starts from 0 m, needs to cover 800 m
Step 2: Analyze the speed ratio
Speed ratio A:B = 2:1
This means A is twice as fast as B
When A covers 2 m, B covers 1 m
Step 3: Calculate distance covered by B when A finishes
A covers 560 m to reach the finish line
In the same time, B covers: (1/2) × 560 = 280 m
Step 4: Calculate winning margin
When A finishes at 800 m, B is at 280 m
Distance B still needs to cover = 800 - 280 = 520 m
A wins by 520 m
Step 5: Verification
Time taken by A = 560 ÷ (speed of A)
Distance by B in same time = 280 m (since B is half as fast)
B's remaining distance = 800 - 280 = 520 m 
Therefore, A wins by 520 m.
4. X runs 5/2 times as fast as Y. If X gives Y a start of 120 meters, how far must the winning post be so that X and Y might reach it at the same time?
 Options:
 A. 300 meters
B. 240 meters
C. 200 meters
D. 360 meters
Answer: A. 300 meters
Solution :
Step 1: Understand the speed relationship
X runs 5/2 times as fast as Y
Speed of X = (5/2) × Speed of Y
Speed ratio X:Y = 5:2
Step 2: Set up the race conditions
Let the winning post be at distance D from the starting point
X starts from 0 and covers distance D
Y gets a 120 m head start, so Y covers (D - 120) m
They reach at the same time
Step 3: Use time equation (Time = Distance/Speed)
Time for X = D / Speed_X
Time for Y = (D - 120) / Speed_Y
Since they take the same time: D / 5 = (D - 120) / 2
Step 4: Solve for D
Cross multiply: 2D = 5(D - 120)
2D = 5D - 600
-3D = -600
D = 200 meters
Step 5: Verification
X covers 200 m at speed ratio 5
Y covers 80 m (200-120) at speed ratio 2
Time ratio: 200/5 = 40 units, 80/2 = 40 units 
Therefore, the winning post must be 200 meters from the starting point.
5. In a 200 m race, P can beat Q by 40 m, and Q can beat R by 10 m. In the same race, P can beat R by:
Options:
A. 24 m
B. 30 m
C. 48 m
D. 50 m
Answer: C. 48 m
Solution :
Step 1: Find the speed ratio of P and Q
When P covers 200 m, Q covers 160 m (beaten by 40 m)
Speed ratio P:Q = 200:160 = 5:4
Step 2: Find the speed ratio of Q and R
When Q covers 200 m, R covers 190 m (beaten by 10 m)
Speed ratio Q:R = 200:190 = 20:19
Step 3: Combine the ratios to find P:R
P:Q = 5:4 = 25:20 (multiply by 5 to match Q's value)
Q:R = 20:19 (Q is already 20)
Combined ratio P:Q:R = 25:20:19
Step 4: Calculate how much P beats R
When P covers 200 m, R covers: (19/25) × 200 = 152 m
P beats R by: 200 - 152 = 48 m
Therefore, in a 200 m race, P can beat R by 48 m.
6. In a race of 100 m, P can beat Q by 10 m and R by 19 m. In a race of 300 m, Q will beat R by:
 Options:
 A. 20 m
B. 27 m
C. 30 m
D. 35 m
Answer: C. 30 m
Solution :
Step 1: Find speed ratios from the 100 m race
When P covers 100 m, Q covers 90 m
Speed ratio P:Q = 100:90 = 10:9
Step 2: Find P's ratio with R
When P covers 100 m, R covers 81 m
Speed ratio P:R = 100:81
Step 3: Determine Q:R ratio
P:Q = 10:9 = 100:90 (multiply by 10)
P:R = 100:81 (already matching)
Combined ratio P:Q:R = 100:90:81
Speed ratio Q:R = 90:81 = 10:9
Step 4: Calculate result in 300 m race
When Q covers 300 m, R covers: (9/10) × 300 = 270 m
Q beats R by: 300 - 270 = 30 m
Therefore, in a 300 m race, Q will beat R by exactly 30 meters.
7. Three swimmers, X, Y, and Z, swim a race, with swimmer X finishing 15 meters ahead of swimmer Y and 20 meters ahead of swimmer Z, while swimmer Y finishes 10 meters ahead of swimmer Z. Each swimmer swims the entire distance at a constant speed. What was the length of the race?
Options:
A. 20 meters
B. 30 meters
C. 40 meters
D. 50 meters
Answer: B. 30 meters
Solution:
Step 1: Set up the race conditions
Let the race length = L meters
When X finishes L meters:
Y has covered (L - 15) meters
Z has covered (L - 20) meters
Step 2: Establish Y and Z relationship
When Y finishes L meters, Z has covered (L - 10) meters
This gives us speed ratio Y:Z = L:(L - 10)
Step 3: Find Y:Z ratio from X's finish
Speed ratio X:Y:Z = L:(L-15):(L-20)
Speed ratio Y:Z = (L-15):(L-20)
Step 4: Equate the two Y:Z ratios
Since both represent the same speed ratio:
(L-15)/(L-20) = L/(L-10)
Step 5: Solve for L
Cross multiply: (L-15)(L-10) = L(L-20)
Expand: L² - 10L - 15L + 150 = L² - 20L
Simplify: L² - 25L + 150 = L² - 20L
Cancel L²: -25L + 150 = -20L
Solve: 150 = 5L
L = 30 meters
Step 6: Verification
When X finishes 30m: Y at 15m, Z at 10m → Y:Z = 15:10 = 3:2
When Y finishes 30m: Z at 20m → Y:Z = 30:20 = 3:2 
Y finishes 10m ahead of Z: 30 - 20 = 10 
Therefore, the length of the race was 30 meters.
8. A car approaches a tunnel AB. Inside the tunnel is a bird located at a point that is 1/4th of the distance AB measured from the entrance A. When the car honks, the bird flies. If the bird flies to the entrance A of the tunnel, the car catches the bird exactly at the entrance. If the bird flies to the exit B of the tunnel, the car catches the bird at exactly the exit. What is the ratio of the speed of the car to the speed of the bird?
 Options:
 A. 2 : 1
B. 3 : 1
C. 4 : 1
D. 5 : 1
Answer: A. 2 : 1
Solution :
Step 1: Set up the problem
Let tunnel length = L
Bird's initial position = L/4 from entrance A
Car's distance from entrance A = d
Speed of car = v_c, Speed of bird = v_b
Step 2: Scenario 1 - Bird flies to entrance A
Bird's distance to A = L/4
Car's distance to A = d
Both take the same time: (L/4)/v_b = d/v_c
Therefore: L/(4v_b) = d/v_c ... equation (1)
Step 3: Scenario 2 - Bird flies to exit B
Bird's distance to B = 3L/4
Car's distance to B = d + L
Both take the same time: (3L/4)/v_b = (d + L)/v_c
Therefore: 3L/(4v_b) = (d + L)/v_c ... equation (2)
Step 4: Divide equation (1) by equation (2)
[L/(4v_b)] / [3L/(4v_b)] = [d/v_c] / [(d+L)/v_c]
1/3 = d/(d + L)
d + L = 3d
L = 2d
Step 5: Find the speed ratio
Substitute L = 2d into equation (1):
(2d)/(4v_b) = d/v_c
2d/(4v_b) = d/v_c
Cancel d: 2/(4v_b) = 1/v_c
2v_c = 4v_b
v_c = 2v_b
Ratio v_c : v_b = 2 : 1
