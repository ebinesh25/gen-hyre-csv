1.Find the HCF of 120, 180, and 240.

Options:
A. 36        
B. 72
C. 60        
D. 54

Answer: C. 60

Solution:
Factorize each number:
120 = 2^3 x 3 x 5, 
180 = 2^2 x 3^2 x 5,
240 = 2^4 x 3 x 5.
Common factors are 2^2, 3, and 5, 
So, HCF = 2^2 x 3 x 5 = 60.


2.The product of two numbers is 6930. If their HCF is 21, what is their LCM?


Options:
A. 240        
B. 180
C. 220        
D. 330

Answer: D. 330

Solution:
LCM×HCF= 2286,
we know that,Product of two numbers = Product of HCF and LCM.
LCM = 6930 / 21 = 330.


3.Three numbers are in the ratio of 2 : 3 : 4 and their LCM is 1800. What is their HCF?


Options:
A. 90        
B. 180
C. 200        
D. 150

Answer: D. 150

Solution:
Let the three numbers be 2x, 3x, and 4x.
Then their LCM is 12x = 1800, so x = 150. 
The numbers are (2 x150), (3 x 150) and (4 x 150).
Hence, required H.C.F. = 150.


4.HCF of two numbers is 10 and their sum is 350. How many such pairs of numbers are possible?


Options:
A. 240        
B. 346
C. 226
D. 300

Answer: B. 346

Solution:
The divisors of 10 that divide 350 are 1 and 5.
For each divisor, we can find the corresponding pairs as follows:
When the divisor is 1: the number of pairs is (350-1)/2 = 174.
When the divisor is 5: the number of pairs is (350-5)/2 = 172.
Therefore, the total number of pairs is 174+172 = 346.


5.The number of number pairs lying between 22 and  88 with their HCF as 44 is


Options:
A. 2        
B. 3
C. 1
D. 6

Answer: C.1

Solution:
To find the number of pairs of numbers that lie between 22 and 88 with their HCF as 44, 
we can use the following formula:
Number of pairs = Number of divisors of 44 that lie between 22/44 and 88/44
The divisors of 44 are 1, 2, 4, 11, 22, and 44.
The divisors that lie between 22/44 and 88/44 are 1 and 2.
Therefore, the number of pairs of numbers that lie between 22 and 88 with their HCF as 44 is the number of ways to choose two numbers that are both multiples of 44. 
There is only one multiple of 44 between 22 and 88, which is 44 itself.
Therefore, the number of pairs of numbers that lie between 22 and 88 
with their HCF as 44 is 1.


6.What is the minimum number of identical square tiles to required fit in a rectangular floor of dimension 200*720?


Options:
A. 120        
B. 90
C. 112
D. 130

Answer: B.90

Solution:
To find the minimum number of identical square tiles required to fit a rectangular floor of dimension 200*720, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 200 and 720, 
and then divide the area of the rectangle by the square of the GCD.
Using the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 200 and 720:
720 = 200 * 3 + 120
200 = 120 * 1 + 80
120 = 80 * 1 + 40
80 = 40 * 2 + 0
Therefore, the GCD of 200 and 720 is 40.
The area of the rectangle is 200 * 720 = 144000.
Dividing the area of the rectangle by the square of the GCD:
144000 / (40 * 40) = 90
Since we need to use whole square tiles, we round up to the next integer.
Therefore, we need 90 square tiles to fit the rectangular floor. 
Answer: 90.


7.Nine bells commence tolling together and toll at intervals of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 seconds respectively. In 3 hours and 30 minutes, how many times do they toll together?
Options:
 A. 8

B. 12
C. 16
D. 20
Answer: C. 16
Solution:
The bells toll together whenever the elapsed time is a common multiple of all their intervals.
So we find the LCM of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 seconds.
Prime factorisation:
2 = 2
4 = 2²
6 = 2 × 3
8 = 2³
10 = 2 × 5
12 = 2² × 3
14 = 2 × 7
Taking the highest powers of each prime:
LCM = 2³ × 3 × 5 × 7 = 8 × 3 × 5 × 7
8 × 3 = 24
24 × 5 = 120
120 × 7 = 840
So, the bells toll together every 840 seconds.
Now convert 3 hours 30 minutes to seconds:
3 hours 30 minutes = 3.5 hours
3.5 hours = 3.5 × 3600 = 12600 seconds
They toll together at times:
t = 0, 840, 1680, 2520, ..., up to 12600 seconds.
Number of times they toll together = (12600 ÷ 840) + 1
= 15 + 1
= 16 times (including the initial toll at t = 0).


8.There are 45 students from School A, 60 students from School B, and 75 students from School C. What is the minimum number of buses required to transport all the students so that each bus has the same number of students and students from the same school are in the same bus? 


Options:
A. 10        
B. 24
C. 18
D. 12

Answer: D.12

Solution:
To find the minimum number of buses required, 
we need to find the HCF of 45, 60, and 75.
First, let's find the prime factors of each number:
45: 3 x 3 x 5
60: 2 x 2 x 3 x 5
75: 3 x 5 x 5
Next, we can identify the common factors and the greatest common factor:
The common factors are 3 and 5.
The greatest common factor is the product of the common factors, which is 3 x 5 = 15.
Therefore, we need to have 15 students in each bus. 
To calculate the number of buses required for each school:
For School A: 45 ÷ 15 = 3 buses
For School B: 60 ÷ 15 = 4 buses
For School C: 75 ÷ 15 = 5 buses
So the minimum number of buses required is 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 buses.


9.Find the greatest number that will divide 72, 90, and 126 leaving the same remainder in each case.

Options:
A. 10        
B. 24
C. 18
D. 12

Answer: C.18

Solution:
The differences between the given numbers are 18 and 54.
The HCF of 18 and 54 is 18. 
Therefore, the greatest number that will divide 72, 90, and 126 leaving the same remainder in each case is 18.


10.The least number which when divided by 3, 4 ,6 and 8 leaves a remainder 2, but when divided by 5 leaves no remainder, is:


Options:
A. 20
B. 40
C. 60        
D. 50

Answer: D.50        

solution:
LCM of 3, 4 ,6 and 8 = 48.
Hence the number can be written in the form (48k+2) which is divisible by 5.
If k=1, number =(48×1)+2 = 50 which is  divisible by 5.
Hence, 50 is the least number which when divided by 3, 4 ,6 and 8 leaves a remainder 2, 
but when divided by 5 leaves no remainder.


11.The least number which when divided by 9,12,16,30 leaves in each case a remainder of 3  is 


Options:
A. 720
B. 723
C. 823        
D. 750

Answer: B. 723

solution:
9=3×3
12=3×2×2
16=2×2×2×2
30=3×5×2
LCM = 2×3×2×3×1×4×5=720
∴ required number=720+3=723


12.Find the least natural number which leaves the remainders 6 and 8 when divided by 7 and 9 respectively.

Options:
A.62
B.52
C.40
D.68

Answer : A.62

Solution:
7 × 9 = 63.
Here, 63 − 1 = 7 × 9 − 1 = 7 (8 + 1) − 1 = 7 × 8 + 7 − 1 = 7 × 8 + 6.
63 − 1 = 7 × 9 − 1 = 9 × (6 + 1) − 1 = 9 × 6 + 9 − 1 = 9 × 6 + 8.
Hence, the least natural number is 62.
