1.A sum of Rs 8,000 amounts to Rs 9,200 in 3 years at the rate of simple interest. Find the rate percent.


Options:
A. 3%
B. 4%
C. 5%
D. 6%


Answer: C. 5%


Solution:
Simple Interest (SI) = (Principal Amount * Rate * Time) / 100
SI = (8,000 * R * 3) / 100
9,200 - 8,000 = (8,000 * R * 3) / 100
1,200 = 24,000R / 100
1,200 = 240R
R = 1,200 / 240
R = 5
So, the rate percent is 5%.
2. Rs 6,000 becomes Rs 7,200 in 4 years at a certain rate of simple interest. If the rate becomes 1.5 times of itself, the amount of the same principal in 5 years will be:
 Options:
A. Rs 8,000
B. Rs 8,250
C. Rs 9,000
D. Rs 9,200
Answer: B. Rs 8,250
Solution:
Step 1: Find the original rate of interest
Given:
Principal (P) = Rs 6,000
Amount = Rs 7,200
Time (T) = 4 years
Simple Interest (SI) = Amount - Principal = 7,200 - 6,000 = Rs 1,200
Using the formula: SI = (P × R × T) / 100
1,200 = (6,000 × R × 4) / 100 1,200 = 24,000R / 100 1,200 = 240R R = 1,200 ÷ 240 R = 5%
Step 2: Find the new rate
New Rate = 1.5 × 5% = 7.5%
Step 3: Calculate amount with new rate in 5 years
SI = (P × R × T) / 100 SI = (6,000 × 7.5 × 5) / 100 SI = 225,000 / 100 SI = Rs 2,250
Amount = Principal + SI Amount = 6,000 + 2,250 = Rs 8,250Therefore, the amount will be Rs 8,250.
3. In how many years will Rs 240 at 10% simple interest produce the same interest as Rs 300 at 8% simple interest in 5 years?
Options:
A. 12 years
B. 5 years
C. 15 years
D. 8 years
Answer: B. 5 years
Solution:
Step 1: Calculate the interest produced by Rs 300 at 8% for 5 years
SI₁ = (P × R × T) / 100 SI₁ = (300 × 8 × 5) / 100 SI₁ = 12,000 / 100 SI₁ = Rs 120
Step 2: Find the time required for Rs 240 at 10% to produce the same interest
Let the required number of years be x.
SI₂ = (240 × 10 × x) / 100
Since both interests are equal: SI₁ = SI₂ 120 = (240 × 10 × x) / 100 120 = 2,400x / 100 120 = 24x x = 120 ÷ 24 x = 5 years
Therefore, Rs 240 at 10% will produce the same interest in 5 years.
4. A sum of money amounts to Rs 8,000 after 3 years and Rs 11,000 after 6 years at the same rate of simple interest. Find the rate of interest per annum.
Options:
A. 12%
B. 9%
C. 8%
D. 20%
Answer: D. 20%
Solution:
Given:
Amount after 3 years (A₃) = Rs 8,000
Amount after 6 years (A₆) = Rs 11,000
Step 1: Find Simple Interest for 3 years (from year 3 to year 6)
Since the interest rate is constant, the interest earned from year 3 to year 6 is: SI for 3 years = A₆ - A₃ = 11,000 - 8,000 = Rs 3,000
Step 2: Find Simple Interest per year
SI per year = 3,000 ÷ 3 = Rs 1,000
Step 3: Find total Simple Interest for first 3 years
SI for first 3 years = 1,000 × 3 = Rs 3,000
Step 4: Find the Principal
Amount = Principal + Simple Interest 8,000 = P + 3,000 P = Rs 5,000
Step 5: Calculate Rate of Interest
Using the formula: SI = (P × R × T) / 100
3,000 = (5,000 × R × 3) / 100 3,000 = 15,000R / 100 300,000 = 15,000R R = 300,000 ÷ 15,000 R = 20%
Therefore, the rate of interest per annum is 20%.

5.A sum of money invested at an interest rate of 4% for the first 4 years, 6% for the next 6 years, and 8% for the period beyond 10 years. If the total interest earned in 15 years is Rs. 9,200, what was the initial investment? 

Options:
A.Rs. 11,150
B.Rs. 12,140
C.Rs. 10,140
D.Rs. 10,000


Answer: D.Rs. 10000


Solution:
Given:
The rate of interest on a sum for the first 3 years is 8% P. a.
For the next 4 years, it is 10% p. a.
For the period beyond 7 years, it is 16% p. a.
A person gets Rs. 11340 simple interest after 10 years.
Concept used:
For simple interest, the rate of interest will always be the same every year.
The principal will always be considered as 100%
Formula used:
S.l = PRT/100
Where S.l is Simple interest, P is Principal, T is time period
Calculation:
The overall rate of interest for the first 3 years at 8% = (3 x 8)% = 24%
The overall rate of interest for the next 4 years at 10% = (4 x 10)% = 40%
Now, according to the question the person invested his principal for 10
years.
So, for the remaining 3 years, the rate of interest will be 16% per annum.
Then, his rate of interest for 3 years will be (16 x 3)% = 48%
Total interest will be received for 10 years is (24% + 40% + 48%) = 112% of
the principal.
So, 112% = 11340
100% = 11340/112 x100
=10125
∴He invested Rs. 10125 for 10 years.
6. Anjali took a loan at 8% per annum simple interest. She paid back the principal and the interest, totaling Rs 9,800 after 5 years. Find the principal amount.
Options:
A. Rs 6,000
B. Rs 6,500
C. Rs 7,000
D. Rs 7,500
Answer: C. Rs 7,000
Solution:
Let the principal amount be P.
Given:
Rate (R) = 8% per annum
Time (T) = 5 years
Total Amount (A) = Rs 9,800
We know that: Amount = Principal + Simple Interest A = P + SI
Also, SI = (P × R × T) / 100
Substituting: A = P + (P × R × T) / 100 9,800 = P + (P × 8 × 5) / 100 9,800 = P + (40P) / 100 9,800 = P + 0.4P 9,800 = 1.4P P = 9,800 ÷ 1.4 P = Rs 7,000
Therefore, the principal amount is Rs 7,000.
7. What is the simple interest on Rs 12,000 at 6% per annum for 5 months?
Options:
 A. Rs 400
B. Rs 300
C. Rs 600
D. Rs 100
Answer: B. Rs 300
Solution:
Given:
Principal (P) = Rs 12,000
Rate (R) = 6% per annum
Time (T) = 5 months = 5/12 years
Using the Simple Interest formula:
SI = (P × R × T) / 100
Substituting the values:
SI = (12,000 × 6 × 5/12) / 100
SI = (12,000 × 6 × 5) / (12 × 100)
SI = 360,000 / 1,200
SI = Rs 300
Therefore, the simple interest is Rs 300.
8. Find the simple interest on Rs 4,000 at 50/4% per annum for the period from 4th Feb 2005 to 18th April 2005.
Options:
 A. Rs 140
B. Rs 120
C. Rs 80
D. Rs 100
Answer: D. Rs 100
Solution:
Given:
Principal (P) = Rs 4,000
Rate (R) = 50/4% = 12.5% per annum
Period: 4th February 2005 to 18th April 2005
Step 1: Calculate the number of days
February 2005 (from 4th to 28th): 28 - 4 + 1 = 25 days
March 2005: 31 days
April 2005 (from 1st to 18th): 18 days
Wait, let me recalculate more carefully:
February: From 4th to end of Feb = (28 - 4) = 24 days (not counting 4th) Or counting 4th: From 4th onwards = (28 - 3) = 25 days
Standard practice: Count from 4th Feb to 18th April
Remaining days in February after 4th = 28 - 4 = 24 days
Full March = 31 days
April (1st to 18th) = 18 days
Total days = 24 + 31 + 18 = 73 days
Step 2: Convert time to years
Time (T) = 73/365 years
Step 3: Calculate Simple Interest
Using the formula: SI = (P × R × T) / 100
SI = (4,000 × 12.5 × 73) / (365 × 100)
SI = (4,000 × 12.5 × 73) / 36,500
SI = 3,650,000 / 36,500
SI = Rs 100
Therefore, the simple interest is Rs 100.
9. If X lends Rs 5,000 to Y at 9% p.a. and Y lends the same sum to Z at 12% p.a., then the gain of Y (in Rs) in a period of 2 years is?
 Options:
 A. Rs 400
B. Rs 350
C. Rs 300
D. Rs 500
Answer: C. Rs 300
Solution:
Given:
X lends Rs 5,000 to Y at 9% per annum
Y lends Rs 5,000 to Z at 12% per annum
Time period = 2 years
Y's gain = Interest received from Z - Interest paid to X
Step 1: Calculate interest Y pays to X
SI paid by Y = (P × R × T) / 100 SI paid by Y = (5,000 × 9 × 2) / 100 SI paid by Y = 90,000  / 100 SI paid by Y = Rs 900
Step 2: Calculate interest Y receives from Z
SI received by Y = (P × R × T) / 100 SI received by Y = (5,000 × 12 × 2) / 100 SI received by Y = 120,000 / 100 SI received by Y = Rs 1,200
Step 3: Calculate Y's net gain
Y's gain = Interest received - Interest paid Y's gain = 1,200 - 900 Y's gain = Rs 300
Therefore, Y's gain in 2 years is Rs 300.
10. At what rate percent per annum will the simple interest on a sum of money be equal to the principal amount in 25 years?
Options:
A. 3%
B. 4%
C. 5%
D. 6%
Answer: B. 4%
Solution:
Let the principal amount be P and the rate be R% per annum.
Given:
Time (T) = 25 years
Simple Interest (SI) = Principal (P) [According to the condition]
Using the Simple Interest formula: SI = (P × R × T) / 100
Since SI = P (given condition): P = (P × R × 25) / 100
Dividing both sides by P: 1 = (R × 25) / 100
Multiply both sides by 100: 100 = 25R
R = 100 ÷ 25 R = 4%
Therefore, the rate is 4% per annum.
11. A sum doubles in 10 years. How long will it take for the same sum to triple?
Options:
A. 12 years
B. 20 years
C. 15 years
D. 8 years
Answer: B. 20 years
Solution:
Let the principal amount be P.
Step 1: Find the rate of interest
When a sum doubles:
Amount = 2P
Simple Interest = Amount - Principal = 2P - P = P
Time = 10 years
Using the formula: SI = (P × R × T) / 100
P = (P × R × 10) / 100 100P = 10PR R = 100P / 10P R = 10% per annum
Step 2: Find time required for sum to triple
When a sum triples:
Amount = 3P
Simple Interest = 3P - P = 2P
Rate = 10% per annum
Using the formula: SI = (P × R × T) / 100
2P = (P × 10 × T) / 100 200P = 10PT T = 200P / 10P T = 20 years
Therefore, it will take 20 years for the sum to triple.
12. An amount out of Rs 15,000 was lent at 10% per annum, and the remaining at 6% per annum. If the total simple interest from both the fractions in 2 years was Rs 2,400, find the sum lent at 10% per annum.
Options:
A. Rs 9,000
B. Rs 7,500
C. Rs 7,000
D. Rs 5,000
Answer: B. Rs 7,500
Solution:
Let the amount lent at 10% per annum be Rs x. Then, the amount lent at 6% per annum = Rs (15,000 - x)
Given:
Time (T) = 2 years
Total Simple Interest = Rs 2,400
Using the formula: SI = (P × R × T) / 100
Simple Interest from amount at 10%: SI₁ = (x × 10 × 2) / 100 = 20x / 100 = 0.2x
Simple Interest from amount at 6%: SI₂ = ((15,000 - x) × 6 × 2) / 100 SI₂ = (180,000 - 12x) / 100 SI₂ = 1,800 - 0.12x
Total Simple Interest: SI₁ + SI₂ = 2,400 0.2x + 1,800 - 0.12x = 2,400 0.08x + 1,800 = 2,400 0.08x = 2,400 - 1,800 0.08x = 600 x = 600 ÷ 0.08 x = 7,500
Therefore, the sum lent at 10% per annum is Rs 7,500.
13. Calculate the simple interest on Rs 7,500 for 4 years at the rate of 6%.
Options:
A. Rs 1,400
B. Rs 1,600
C. Rs 1,800
D. Rs 2,000
Answer: C. Rs 1,800
Solution:
To calculate the simple interest (SI), we use the formula:
SI = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100
Given:
Principal (P) = Rs 7,500
Rate (R) = 6% per annum
Time (T) = 4 years
Substituting the values:
SI = (7,500 × 6 × 4) / 100 SI = 180,000 / 100 SI = Rs 1,800
Therefore, the simple interest on Rs 7,500 for 4 years at 6% is Rs 1,800.
14. If a total sum of Rs 3,000 is lent at 4% and 5% per annum simple interest, and the total interest earned in 2 years is Rs 220, find the ratio of the money lent at 4% to that lent at 5%.
Options:
A. 4:1
B. 1:2
C. 3:1
D. 2:1
Answer: D. 2:1
Solution:
Let x = amount lent at 4% per annum Let y = amount lent at 5% per annum
Given:
Total sum: x + y = 3,000 ... (Equation 1)
Time = 2 years
Total interest = Rs 220
Using the Simple Interest formula: SI = (P × R × T) / 100
Interest from amount at 4%: SI₁ = (x × 4 × 2) / 100 = 8x / 100
Interest from amount at 5%: SI₂ = (y × 5 × 2) / 100 = 10y / 100
Total Interest: 8x/100 + 10y/100 = 220 (8x + 10y) / 100 = 220 8x + 10y = 22,000 ... (Equation 2)
Solving the system of equations:
From Equation 1: x + y = 3,000 Multiply by 8: 8x + 8y = 24,000 ... (Equation 3)
Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 3: (8x + 8y) - (8x + 10y) = 24,000 - 22,000 -2y = 2,000 y = 1,000
Substitute y = 1,000 into Equation 1: x + 1,000 = 3,000 x = 2,000
Therefore:
Amount lent at 4% = Rs 2,000
Amount lent at 5% = Rs 1,000
Ratio = 2,000 : 1,000 = 2:1
15. What is the simple interest on a debt of Rs 10,000 for 3 years at 8% per annum?
Options:
A. Rs 2,400
B. Rs 2,000
C. Rs 1,800
D. Rs 1,600
Answer: A. Rs 2,400
Solution:
To calculate the simple interest, we use the formula:
SI = (P × R × T) / 100
Given:
Principal (P) = Rs 10,000
Rate (R) = 8% per annum
Time (T) = 3 years
Substituting the values:
SI = (10,000 × 8 × 3) / 100 SI = 240,000 / 100 SI = Rs 2,400
Therefore, the simple interest on Rs 10,000 for 3 years at 8% per annum is Rs 2,400.
Total Amount to be repaid: Amount = Principal + SI = 10,000 + 2,400 = Rs 12,400
16. Rs 1,720 is to be paid in 4 equal installments in 4 years. Find each installment if the rate of interest is 5% per annum (simple interest).
Options:
A. Rs 450
B. Rs 465
C. Rs 483
D. Rs 500
Answer: C. Rs 483
Solution:
Let each installment be Rs x.
For simple interest installments, the present value of each installment is calculated, and their sum equals the principal amount.
The installments are due at the end of years 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Present Value formula: PV = Installment / (1 + (R × T)/100)
Where R = 5% per annum and T = time when payment is due
Present value of all 4 installments:
PV₁ = x / (1 + 5×1/100) = x / 1.05
PV₂ = x / (1 + 5×2/100) = x / 1.10
PV₃ = x / (1 + 5×3/100) = x / 1.15
PV₄ = x / (1 + 5×4/100) = x / 1.20
Sum of Present Values = Principal:
x/1.05 + x/1.10 + x/1.15 + x/1.20 = 1,720
x(1/1.05 + 1/1.10 + 1/1.15 + 1/1.20) = 1,720
x(0.9524 + 0.9091 + 0.8696 + 0.8333) = 1,720
x(3.5644) = 1,720
x = 1,720 ÷ 3.5644
x = Rs 483 (approximately)
Therefore, each installment is Rs 483.
