objective,"Kiran and Divya invest in a business in the ratio 2:3. If 6% of the total profit goes to charity and Kiran's share is Rs 752, what is the total profit?",4,"Rs 1,800","Rs 1,900","Rs 2,000","Rs 2,100",3,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","*Let the total profit be T. Given: Investment ratio of Kiran : Divya = 2:3 Charity = 6% of total profit Kiran's share = Rs 752 Step 1: Calculate profit after charity Profit after charity = T - 6% of T = 94% of T = 0.94T Step 2: Calculate Kiran's share Total parts in ratio = 2 + 3 = 5 Kiran's share = (2/5) of remaining profit 752 = (2/5) × 0.94T 752 = 1.88T / 5 752 × 5 = 1.88T 3,760 = 1.88T T = 3,760 ÷ 1.88 T = Rs 2,000 Therefore, the total profit is Rs 2,000.",,,,,
objective,"Amit, Priya, and Rajesh decided to invest in a business. Amit invested Rs 6,000 for 6 months, Priya invested Rs 8,000 for 6 months, and Rajesh invested Rs 10,000 for 6 months. Amit, who was the active member, agreed to receive 4% of the profits. If the total profit earned was Rs 7,500, what is Rajesh's share in the profit?",4,"Rs 2,700","Rs 2,800","Rs 2,900","Rs 3,000",4,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","*Step 1: Calculate Amit's management fee Amit's management fee = 4% of Rs 7,500 = 7,500 × 0.04 = Rs 300 Step 2: Calculate remaining profit to be distributed Remaining profit = 7,500 - 300 = Rs 7,200 Step 3: Calculate investment ratio based on capital × time Since all three invested for the same period (6 months), the ratio is based on their capital amounts: Amit's investment = 6,000 × 6 = 36,000 Priya's investment = 8,000 × 6 = 48,000 Rajesh's investment = 10,000 × 6 = 60,000 Ratio = 36,000 : 48,000 : 60,000 Dividing by 12,000 (GCD): Ratio = 3 : 4 : 5 Step 4: Calculate Rajesh's share Total parts = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 Rajesh's share = (5/12) × 7,200 = 5 × 600 = Rs 3,000 Therefore, Rajesh's share in the profit is Rs 3,000.",,,,,
objective,"Three partners shared the profit in a business in the ratio 6:8:9. They had partnered for 18 months, 15 months, and 12 months, respectively. What was the ratio of their investments?",4,20:32:45,10:16:22,4:5:6,5:8:9,1,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","*We know that: Investment × Time = Profit Share Let the investments be x, y, and z for the three partners. Given: Time periods: 18 months, 15 months, 12 months Profit ratio: 6:8:9 Therefore: 18x : 15y : 12z = 6 : 8 : 9 Step 1: Find relationship between x and y 18x/15y = 6/8 Cross multiply: 18x × 8 = 15y × 6 144x = 90y y = 144x/90 = 8x/5 Step 2: Find relationship between x and z 18x/12z = 6/9 Cross multiply: 18x × 9 = 12z × 6 162x = 72z z = 162x/72 = 9x/4 Step 3: Calculate investment ratio x : y : z = x : 8x/5 : 9x/4 To eliminate fractions, multiply by 20 (LCM of 5 and 4): = 20x : 32x : 45x = 20 : 32 : 45 Therefore, the ratio of their investments is 20:32:45.",,,,,
objective,"M and N entered into a partnership with capitals in the ratio 5:6. After 5 months, M withdrew 1/4 of his capital, and N withdrew 1/5 of his capital. The gain at the end of 8 months was Rs 720.
