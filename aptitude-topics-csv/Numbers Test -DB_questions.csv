objective,The remainder obtained when a prime number greater than 3 is divided by 6 is always  ,3,1 or 3,1 or 5,3 or 5,,3,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","* Every integer when divided by 6 leaves a remainder 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. If a number leaves remainder 0, 2, or 4, it is even, so it cannot be an odd prime (except 2, but we are considering primes greater than 3). If a number leaves remainder 3, then it is divisible by 3, so it cannot be prime (except 3 itself, but we are considering primes greater than 3). So a prime number greater than 3 cannot be of the form: 6k, 6k + 2, 6k + 3, or 6k + 4. The only possible forms left are: 6k + 1 and 6k + 5. Therefore, a prime number greater than 3, when divided by 6, leaves a remainder 1 or 5. Hence, the correct answer is C. 1 or 5.",,,,,
objective,What is the total number of factors for 90?  ,3,8 factors,9 factors,10 factors,,1,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","* To find the total number of factors for 90, we can start by finding the prime factorization of 90. The prime factorization of 90 is: 2 \ 3^2 \ 5 To determine the total number of factors, we consider the exponents of the prime factors. In this case, the exponents are 1, 2, and 1.

objective,"You have 70 doors in a row that are all initially closed. You make 70 passes by the doors starting with the first door every time. The first time through, you visit every door and toggle the door (if the door is closed, you open it; if it is open, you close it). The second time, you only visit every 2nd door (door #2, #4, #6, …). The third time, every 3rd door (door #3, #6, #9, …), and so on, until you only visit the 70th door. How many doors are opened at last? ",4,4 doors are opened.,7 doors are opened.,8 doors are opened.,10 doors are opened.,3,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","* Each door is toggled once for every divisor of its door number. That is, door n is toggled on pass k whenever k divides n. Therefore, the number of times a door is toggled is equal to the number of divisors of that door number. A door will remain open if it is toggled an odd number of times. The only numbers that have an odd number of divisors are perfect squares. So, we list the perfect squares less than or equal to 70: 1² = 1 2² = 4 3² = 9 4² = 16 5² = 25 6² = 36 7² = 49 8² = 64 There are 8 such doors: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, and 64. Therefore, 8 doors remain open at the end. Hence, the correct answer is C) 8 doors are opened.",,,,,
objective,"At a mystical castle, several bells ring at regular intervals of time. Each bell rings at a different fixed interval, measured in whole hours (no fractions), and each bell rings an exact whole number of times in a 24-hour day. What is the maximum number of such bells that can be found in the castle ? ",3,8 bells,10 bells,12 bells,,2,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","* Each bell rings at a fixed interval in whole hours and must complete an exact number of cycles in a 24-hour day. That means the time interval of each bell must be a factor of 24 (because 24 must be divisible by the interval). The positive factors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 Each different factor can correspond to a different bell's ringing interval. So, the maximum number of bells (each with a distinct interval) is the number of factors of 24, which is 8. Therefore, there can be 8 bells in the castle. Hence, the correct answer is B.8 bells.",,,,,

We are told that 8HT0 is divisible by 12. A number is divisible by 12 if and only if: It is divisible by 3, and It is divisible by 4. (i) Divisibility by 4 A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. The last two digits are T0, i.e., 10T. So 10T must be divisible by 4.

objective,"Two 3-digit numbers X78 and 489 are added to give a 4-digit number 10Y7, which is divisible by 11. Determine the value of (X + Y). ",3,11,12,15,,2,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","* We are given that X78 + 489 = 10Y7, and 10Y7 is divisible by 11. Step 1: Use the divisibility rule for 11. For a number to be divisible by 11, (sum of digits in odd positions) - (sum of digits in even positions) must be a multiple of 11 (including 0). Digits of 10Y7 are: 1, 0, Y, 7. Odd positions: 1 and Y → 1 + Y Even positions: 0 and 7 → 0 + 7 = 7 Difference = (1 + Y) - 7 = Y - 6 For divisibility by 11, this difference must be 0 (the only possible multiple of 11 for a single-digit Y). So, Y - 6 = 0 → Y = 6. Thus, the number is 1067. Step 2: Find X using the addition. X78 + 489 = 1067 So, X78 = 1067 - 489 = 578 Therefore, X78 = 578, which gives X = 5. Step 3: Compute X + Y. X + Y = 5 + 6 = 11. Hence, the correct answer is 11.",,,,,

objective,The number obtained by interchanging the two digits of a two-digit number is greater than the original number by 27. The sum of the two digits of the number is 13. What is the original number? ,3,69,83,92,,1,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","* Let's assume the original two-digit number as ""10x + y"", where x represents the tens digit and y represents the ones digit. According to the problem, we have the following information: Interchanging the digits gives us the number ""10y + x"". The interchanged number is greater than the original number by 27, so we have the equation: (10y + x) = (10x + y) + 27. We also know that the sum of the two digits is 13, so we have the equation: x + y = 13. To solve this problem, we can use the given equations to find the values of x and y that satisfy all the conditions. From the equation x + y = 13, we can solve for x in terms of y: x = 13 - y. Substituting this into the equation (10y + x) = (10x + y) + 27, we have: 10y + (13 - y) = 10(13 - y) + y + 27. Simplifying the equation: 9y + 13 = 130 - 10y + y + 27. Combine like terms: 9y + 13 = 157 - 9y. Add 9y to both sides: 18y + 13 = 157. Subtract 13 from both sides: 18y = 144. Divide both sides by 18: y = 8. Substituting the value of y into x + y = 13: x + 8 = 13, x = 5. Therefore, the original number is 58. The original number is 58.",,,,,
