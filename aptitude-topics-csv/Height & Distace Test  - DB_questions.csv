objective,"As observed from the top of a 75 m high lighthouse from the sea-level, the angles of depression of two ships are 30° and 45°. If one ship is exactly behind the other on the same side of the lighthouse, find the distance between the two ships.",4,75 (√3-1) units,8 units,12 units,Data inadequate,1,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","* Let the height of the lighthouse from the sea level be AB and the ships are C and D. The angles of depression of the ships C and D from the top A of the lighthouse are 30° and 45° respectively. Distance between the ships = CD = BD − BC In ΔABC, tan 45° = AB/BC 1 = 75/BC BC = 75 In ΔABD, tan 30° = AB/BD 1/√3 = 75/BD BD = 75√3 Distance between two ships CD = BD - BC CD = 75√3 - 75 \= 75 (√3 - 1) Distance between two ships CD is 75 (√3 - 1) m.",,,,,
objective,"A ladder leans against a wall making an angle of measure 60° with the ground. If the foot of the ladder is 3 metres away from the wall, then the length of the ladder is ..... metre. ",3,3√3,6,3√3/2,,3,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","*Given: Angle between ladder and ground = 60° Distance from wall to foot of ladder = 3 meters Let the length of the ladder be l meters. Using trigonometry: In the right triangle formed by the ladder, wall, and ground: Adjacent side (base) = 3 meters Hypotenuse (ladder) = l meters Angle = 60° cos θ = Adjacent/Hypotenuse cos 60° = 3/l We know that cos 60° = 1/2 Therefore: 1/2 = 3/l l = 3 × 2 l = 6 meters Alternative approach using sec: cos 60° = 3/l l = 3/cos 60° l = 3 × sec 60° Since sec 60° = 1/cos 60° = 1/(1/2) = 2 l = 3 × 2 = 6 meters Therefore, the length of the ladder is 6 meters.",,,,,
objective,"The angle of elevation of the sun, when the length of the shadow of a tree is √3 times the height of the tree, is: ",3,45°,60°,90°,,1,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","*Let: AB = height of the tree AC = length of the shadow θ = angle of elevation of the sun (angle ∠ACB) Given: AC = √3 × AB Using trigonometry: In the right triangle formed by the tree, shadow, and sun's rays: tan θ = Opposite/Adjacent = AB/AC Since AC = √3 × AB: tan θ = AB/(√3 × AB) = 1/√3 We know that tan 30° = 1/√3 Therefore: θ = 30° Alternative approach using cotangent: cot θ = Adjacent/Opposite = AC/AB cot θ = (√3 × AB)/AB = √3 We know that cot 30° = √3 Therefore: θ = 30° Therefore, the angle of elevation of the sun is 30°.",,,,,
objective,The angle of elevation of the top of a tower from a point on the ground which is 30 m away from the foot of the tower is 300. Find the height of the tower.,4,30°,10√3,√3,90°,2,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","* Given that, the angle of elevation of the top of a tower from a point on the ground which is 30 m away from the foot of the tower is 30∘. To find out: The height of the tower. Let the height of the tower be h and B be a point on the ground 30 m away from the tower. Consider, the right angled △ABC, as shown in the above figure. We know that, tanB=Opposite Side/Adjacent side​=AC​/BC ∴ tan 30°=h​/30 We know that, tan30°=1/√3 ∴1/√3 ​=h/30​ ⇒h=​ ⇒h=​30​/√3\*√3/√3=30√3/3 ∴ h=10√3​ m Hence, the height of the tower is 10√3​ m.",,,,,
