objective,A man covers the first half of the journey at the speed of 60kmph and the remaining at the speed of 100kmph. Find his average speed? ,3,48km/hr,75km/hr,54km/hr,,1,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","* Let's assume that the total distance of the journey is 'd' km. The first half of the journey would then be 'd/2' km. Time taken to cover the first half of the journey, t1 = (d/2) km ÷ 60 kmph = (d/120) hours. Time taken to cover the second half of the journey, t2 = (d/2) km ÷ 100 kmph = (d/200) hours. Therefore, the total time taken to complete the journey, t = t1 + t2 = (d/120) + (d/200) = (5d/600) + (3d/600) = (8d/600) = (d/75) hours. Average speed = Total distance ÷ Total time = d km ÷ (d/75) hours = 75 kmph. Therefore, the man's average speed for the entire journey is 75 kmph.",,,,,
objective,Karthik travels 24 km at a speed of 8 kmph and then another 48 km at a speed of 16 kmph. What is his average speed for the entire journey?,4,10 kmph,11 kmph,12 kmph,14 kmph,3,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","*Total Distance: = 24 km + 48 km = 72 km Time taken to cover the first 24 km: = Distance / Speed = 24 / 8 = 3 hours Time taken to cover the next 48 km: = Distance / Speed = 48 / 16 = 3 hours Total Time: = 3 + 3 = 6 hours Average Speed: = Total Distance / Total Time = 72 / 6 = 12 kmph Therefore, Karthik's average speed for the entire journey is 12 kmph.",,,,,
objective,"A car travels a total distance of 800 km. It covers the first 200 km at a speed of 40 km/hr, the next 200 km at 75 km/hr, the third 200 km at 150 km/hr, and the final 200 km at 200 km/hr. What is the average speed of the car? ",4,70 km/hr,72 km/hr,80 km/hr,90 km/hr,3,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","*Total distance = 800 km Time for first 200 km at 40 km/hr: \= 200 / 40 \= 5 hours Time for next 200 km at 75 km/hr: \= 200 / 75 \= 8/3 hours Time for third 200 km at 150 km/hr: \= 200 / 150 \= 4/3 hours Time for last 200 km at 200 km/hr: \= 200 / 200 \= 1 hour Total time taken: \= 5 + 8/3 + 4/3 + 1 \= 5 + (8/3 + 4/3) + 1 \= 5 + 12/3 + 1 \= 5 + 4 + 1 \= 10 hours Average speed = Total distance / Total time \= 800 / 10 \= 80 km/hr Therefore, the average speed of the car is 80 km/hr.",,,,,
objective,"A woman completes a journey in 8 hours. She travels the first half of the journey at the rate of 20 km/hr, and the second half at the rate of 30 km/hr. Find the total journey in km.",4,200 km,210 km,192 km,196 km,1,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","* Let us assume that the total journey is ""d"" km. The woman traveled the first half of the journey at the rate of 20 km/hr. Therefore, she would have covered half the distance in time = (1/2d) / 20 = (1/40)d hours. Similarly, she traveled the second half of the journey at the rate of 30 km/hr. Therefore, she would have covered the other half of the distance in time = (1/2d) / 30 = (1/60)d hours. The total time taken for the journey is given as 8 hours. Thus, we can write the equation: (1/40)d + (1/60)d = 8 Simplifying this equation, we get: (3/120)d + (2/120)d = 8 (5/120)d = 8 Now, to find d, we can multiply both sides by (120/5): d = (120/5) × 8 d = 24 × 8 d = 192 km Therefore, the total journey is 192 km.",,,,,
objective,A bus traveling between two towns arrives at its destination 20 minutes late when it goes at 30 kmph and 8 minutes late when it goes at 50 kmph. Determine the distance between the two towns.,4,10 km,12 km,15 km,20 km,3,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","*Let the distance between the two towns be D km. When the bus goes at 30 kmph: Time taken = D/30 hours When the bus goes at 50 kmph: Time taken = D/50 hours Difference in late times: = 20 minutes - 8 minutes = 12 minutes Convert 12 minutes to hours: 12 minutes = 12/60 = 1/5 hour The difference in travel times equals the difference in late times: D/30 - D/50 = 1/5 Taking LCM of 30 and 50 = 150: (5D - 3D)/150 = 1/5 2D/150 = 1/5 D/75 = 1/5 D = 75 × 1/5 D = 15 km Therefore, the distance between the two towns is 15 km.",,,,,

Find her usual time taken to reach the park.",4,30 minutes,36 minutes,18 minutes,45 minutes,3,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","* Since the woman now walks at 3/5 of her usual speed, she will take 5/3 of her usual time. Extra time = (5/3 - 1) x Usual time = 12 minutes (known) (2/3) x Usual time = 12 Usual time = (3/2) x 12 = 18 minutes Therefore, her usual time taken to reach the park is 18 minutes.",,,,,
objective,"A car travels a distance of 240 km in 5 hours, partly at a speed of 60 km/h and partly at a speed of 40 km/h. Find the time it traveled at 60 km/h.",4,2 hours,3 hours,4 hours,2.5 hours,1,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","* Let the time the car traveled at 60 km/h be x hours. Then, the time it traveled at 40 km/h is (5 - x) hours. So, (60x + 40(5 - x)) = 240 ⇒ 60x + 200 - 40x = 240 ⇒ 20x + 200 = 240 ⇒ 20x = 240 - 200 ⇒ 20x = 40 ⇒ x = 40/20 ⇒ x = 2 Therefore, the car traveled at 60 km/h for 2 hours.",,,,,

objective,"Every day, a teacher waits at the school gate for the staff van, and then they go home together. The van is always on time. One day, the teacher finishes work early and reaches the gate 40 minutes before the usual pickup time. The teacher starts walking home, and after some time, the van picks them up on the way. That day, they reach home 20 minutes earlier than usual. How much time did the teacher spend walking?",4,20 minutes,25 minutes,30 minutes,35 minutes,3,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","*Because they reached home 20 minutes earlier than usual, the total time for the usual home-school-home trip (for the van) is reduced by 20 minutes that day. Time saved by the van: Since the van travels from home to the pickup point and then back home, the time saved is equally shared in both directions. Time saved in each direction = 20 ÷ 2 = 10 minutes When the van met the teacher: This means the van met the teacher 10 minutes earlier than the usual pickup time at the gate. Calculating walking time: The teacher reached the gate 40 minutes earlier than the usual pickup time. Out of this 40 minutes, the last 10 minutes is the time ""shifted"" due to the earlier meeting (when the van would have been traveling to the usual pickup point). So, the actual time the teacher spent walking = 40 - 10 = 30 minutes Therefore, the teacher walked for 30 minutes.",,,,,
