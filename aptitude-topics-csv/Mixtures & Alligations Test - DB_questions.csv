According to the problem, the ratio of A and B in the initial mixture is 9 : 4. So, the total mixture in the can is 9x + 4x = 13x. When 13 liters of mixture are drawn off, the remaining mixture in the can is (13x - 13) liters. Now, 13 liters of mixture contains (9/13) x 13 liters of liquid A and (4/13) x 13 liters of liquid B. So, the amount of liquid A in the remaining mixture is (9/13) x 13x liters and the amount of liquid B is (4/13) x 13x liters. When the can is filled with B, the total volume of liquid in the can becomes 13x liters. Let's say y liters of liquid B are added to the can.

According to the problem, the ratio of A and B in the final mixture is 6 : 5. Therefore, we can write: (9/13) x 13x : (4x + y) = 6 : 5 Simplifying this equation, we get: 117x : (4x + y) = 6 : 5 585x = 24x + 5y 561x = 5y y = 561x/5 Now, we know that 13 liters of mixture were drawn off initially, so the amount of liquid B that was present in this 13 liters of mixture is (4/13) x 13x liters.
