objective,"A school has students in the ratio 2 : 3 : 4 in the 9th, 10th, and 11th grades. If the school decides to increase the number of students in each grade by 25%, 30%, and 35%, respectively, what will be the new ratio of students in these grades?  ",4,25:54:39,25:39:54,14:13:27,26:13:54,1,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","* Let's represent the initial number of students in the 9th, 10th, and 11th grades as 2x, 3x, and 4x, respectively, where x is a positive integer. Increase of 25% in the 9th-grade students: New number of 9th-grade students = 2x + 0.25 \* 2x = 2x + 0.5x = 2.5x Increase of 30% in the 10th-grade students: New number of 10th-grade students = 3x + 0.30 \* 3x = 3x + 0.9x = 3.9x Increase of 35% in the 11th-grade students: New number of 11th-grade students = 4x + 0.35 \* 4x = 4x + 1.4x = 5.4x Now, let's find the ratio of the increased students: The ratio of increased students in the 9th, 10th, and 11th grades is 2.5x : 3.9x : 5.4x. We can simplify this ratio by dividing each term by the greatest common factor, which is x: 2.5x : 3.9x : 5.4x = 2.5 : 3.9 : 5.4 To make the ratio more straightforward, we can scale it up by multiplying all terms by a common factor to eliminate decimals. Let's multiply by 10 to get whole numbers: (2.5 \ 10) : (3.9 \ 10) : (5.4 \* 10) = 25 : 39 : 54 So, the new ratio of students in the 9th, 10th, and 11th grades after the increase is 25 : 39 : 54.",,,,,
