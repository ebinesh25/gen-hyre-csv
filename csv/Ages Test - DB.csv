objective,The sum of the ages of 3 cousins born at intervals of 4 years is 33. What is the age of the youngest cousin?,4,7,5,10,6,1,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","Let's assume that the age of the youngest cousin is x. Then, the age of the second and third cousin will be x+4 and x+8, respectively. The sum of their ages is given as 33: x + (x+4) + (x+8) = 33. Simplifying the above equation, we get: 3x + 12 = 33. Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get: 3x = 21. Dividing by 3, we get: x = 7. Therefore, the age of the youngest cousin is 7 years old.",,,,,
objective,"Sarah is 4 years younger than Tom. If their ages are in the respective ratio of 2:3, how old is Sarah?",4,8.5,7.5,8,6.5,3,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","Let's assume that the age of Sarah is x. Then, the age of Tom will be x+4. Their ages are in the ratio of 2:3: x/(x+4) = 2/3. Cross-multiplying the above equation, we get: 3x = 2(x+4). Expanding and simplifying the above equation, we get: x = 8.

objective,"One year ago, a man was 6 times as old as his son. Now his age is equal to the square of his son's age. Find their present ages.",4,25,30,33,24,1,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","Let's assume that the man's current age is ""m"" and his son's current age is ""s"". We know that one year ago, the man was 6 times as old as his son. So, one year ago: m - 1 = 6(s - 1) Expanding this equation: m - 1 = 6s - 6 m = 6s - 5 We also know that the man's current age is equal to the square of his son's age: m = s^2 Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation: s^2 = 6s - 5 Rearranging this equation: s^2 - 6s + 5 = 0 This equation can be factored as: (s - 5)(s - 1) = 0 So, either s = 5 or s = 1. If s = 5, then the son's current age is 5 years old. Substituting this into the equation m = s^2, we get: m = 5^2 = 25 Therefore, the man's current age is 25 years old and his son's current age is 5 years old. If s = 1, then the son's current age is 1 year old. Substituting this into the equation m = s^2, we get: m = 1^2 = 1 Therefore, the man's current age is 1 year old and his son's current age is 1 year old. However, it's unlikely that a man would have a son at the age of 1, so the realistic solution is that the man is 25 years old and his son is 5 years old.",,,,,
