For the next 4 years, it is 10% p. a. For the period beyond 7 years, it is 16% p. a. A person gets Rs. 11340 simple interest after 10 years. Concept used: For simple interest, the rate of interest will always be the same every year. The principal will always be considered as 100% Formula used: S.l = PRT/100 Where S.l is Simple interest, P is Principal, T is time period Calculation: The overall rate of interest for the first 3 years at 8% = (3 x 8)% = 24% The overall rate of interest for the next 4 years at 10% = (4 x 10)% = 40% Now, according to the question the person invested his principal for 10 years. So, for the remaining 3 years, the rate of interest will be 16% per annum. Then, his rate of interest for 3 years will be (16 x 3)% = 48% Total interest will be received for 10 years is (24% + 40% + 48%) = 112% of the principal.
