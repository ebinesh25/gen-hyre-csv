objective,"A hose can fill a water tank in 3 hours, but due to a small crack, it takes 4 hours to fill the tank. How much time will it take to empty the tank if it was full?",4,25 hours,20 hours,15 hours,12 hours,4,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","To find the time it will take to completely empty the tank, we need to determine the rate at which the crack is causing the tank to empty. Let's denote the rate at which the hose can fill the tank as ""F"" (in units of tank volume per hour) and the rate at which the crack is causing the tank to empty as ""E"" (in units of tank volume per hour). From the given information, we know that the hose can fill the tank in 3 hours, so its filling rate is: F = 1 tank volume / 3 hours = 1/3 tank volume per hour Similarly, we know that the hose takes 4 hours to fill the tank due to the crack, so the combined rate of filling and emptying is: F - E = 1 tank volume / 4 hours = 1/4 tank volume per hour Now, we can set up an equation to find the crack's emptying rate: 1/3 - E = 1/4 To solve for E, we can rearrange the equation: E = 1/3 - 1/4 E = (4 - 3) / (3 * 4) E = 1 / 12 tank volume per hour Now that we know the crack's emptying rate, we can determine the time it will take to empty the tank completely. Since the crack is removing 1/12 of the tank volume every hour, it will take 12 hours to completely empty the entire tank. Therefore, it will take 12 hours to completely empty the tank if it was full.",,,,,
objective,Pipe A and B can fill a tank in 30 minutes and 20 minutes respectively. Pipe C can empty the tank in 10 minutes. Pipe A and B are opened simultaneously and after 10 minutes pipe C is also opened. In what time will the tank be emptied after C is opened?,4,55 mins,30 mins,35 mins,50 mins,4,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","Given information: Pipe A fills the tank in 30 minutes ⇒ its rate is 1/30 of the tank per minute Pipe B fills the tank in 20 minutes ⇒ its rate is 1/20 of the tank per minute Pipe C empties the tank in 10 minutes ⇒ its rate is -1/10 of the tank per minute (emptying) Step 1: Amount of water in the tank after first 10 minutes (only A and B open) Combined rate of A and B = 1/30 + 1/20 = 2/60 + 3/60 = 5/60 = 1/12 of the tank per minute In 10 minutes, amount filled = 10 × (1/12) = 10/12 = 5/6 of the tank So, when C is opened, the tank is 5/6 full. Step 2: Net rate when A, B, and C are all open Rate of A = 1/30 Rate of B = 1/20 Rate of C = -1/10 (emptying) Net rate = 1/30 + 1/20 - 1/10 = 2/60 + 3/60 - 6/60 = 5/60 - 6/60 = -1/60 of the tank per minute This means the tank is getting emptied at the rate of 1/60 of the tank per minute. Step 3: Time taken to empty the tank from 5/6 full Time = (Amount of water) ÷ (Rate of emptying) = (5/6) ÷ (1/60) = (5/6) × 60 = 5 × 10 = 50 minutes Therefore, the tank will be emptied in 50 minutes after pipe C is opened.",,,,,
objective,"Two workers A and B can complete a construction project in 10 days. If A takes 6 days longer than B to complete the project alone, how much time will it take for B to complete the project separately?",4,17.44 days,12 days,16 days,18 days,1,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","Let the time taken by worker B to complete the project alone be b days. Then time taken by worker A to complete the project alone is (b + 6) days. Work rates: Rate of A = 1/(b + 6) projects per day Rate of B = 1/b projects per day Together they complete the project in 10 days, so their combined rate is 1/10 projects per day. Therefore: 1/(b + 6) + 1/b = 1/10 Combine the fractions: (b + (b + 6))/(b(b + 6)) = 1/10 (2b + 6)/(b(b + 6)) = 1/10 Cross-multiplying: 10(2b + 6) = b(b + 6) 20b + 60 = b² + 6b Rearranging: b² + 6b - 20b - 60 = 0 b² - 14b - 60 = 0 Solve the quadratic using the formula: b = [14 ± √(14² - 4×1×(-60))]/2 b = [14 ± √(196 + 240)]/2 b = [14 ± √436]/2 b = [14 ± 2√109]/2 b = 7 ± √109 Since time cannot be negative: b = 7 + √109 ≈ 7 + 10.44 = 17.44 days (approximately) Therefore, worker B will take approximately 17.44 days to complete the project separately.",,,,,

objective,"Two pumps A and B can fill a swimming pool in 20 hours and 30 hours, respectively.

Pump A runs for the entire 18 hours. Water filled by A in 18 hours: = 18 × (1/20) = 18/20 = 9/10 of the pool Water filled by B in t hours: = t × (1/30) = t/30 of the pool Total water filled must be 1 (full pool): 9/10 + t/30 = 1 Solving for t: t/30 = 1 - 9/10 t/30 = 1/10 t = 30 × (1/10) t = 3 hours Therefore, pump B should be turned off after 3 hours.",,,,,
objective,"Two pumps can fill a swimming pool in 2 hours and 3 hours, respectively. However, due to a leakage, it takes an extra 20 minutes to fill the pool. How much time will the leakage take to empty the full pool?",4,5.5 hours,4.8 hours,1.8 hours,1.2 hours,1,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","Step 1: Find the normal filling rate of the two pumps (without leakage) Pump 1 fills the pool in 2 hours ⇒ rate = 1/2 pool per hour Pump 2 fills the pool in 3 hours ⇒ rate = 1/3 pool per hour Combined rate of both pumps: 1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6 pool per hour Step 2: Calculate time without leakage Time = 1 ÷ (5/6) = 6/5 hours = 1.2 hours = 72 minutes Step 3: Calculate actual time with leakage Due to leakage, it takes 20 minutes extra, so: Actual time = 72 + 20 = 92 minutes Convert to hours: 92/60 = 46/30 = 23/15 hours Step 4: Find the leakage rate Let the leakage empty the full pool in L hours. Then leakage rate = 1/L pool per hour (emptying). Net rate with leakage: (1/2 + 1/3 - 1/L) = 1/(actual time) = 1 ÷ (23/15) = 15/23 pool per hour Therefore: 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/L = 15/23 5/6 - 1/L = 15/23 Step 5: Solve for L -1/L = 15/23 - 5/6 Compute RHS: 15/23 - 5/6 = (15×6 - 5×23)/(23×6) = (90 - 115)/138 = -25/138 So: -1/L = -25/138 1/L = 25/138 Therefore: L = 138/25 = 5.52 hours ≈ 5.5 hours The leakage will take approximately 5.5 hours to empty the full pool.",,,,,

Find the percentage of the work done by tap A.",4,170%,162%,118%,39%,4,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","Let the capacity of the tank be 1 (one full tank). Rates of filling per hour: Tap A fills the tank in 8 hours ⇒ rate of A = 1/8 Tap B fills the tank in 12 hours ⇒ rate of B = 1/12 Tap C fills the tank in 15 hours ⇒ rate of C = 1/15 Tap D fills the tank in 20 hours ⇒ rate of D = 1/20 Step 1: Work done in the first 3 hours (A, B, C, D all open) Combined rate of A, B, C, D: R_total = 1/8 + 1/12 + 1/15 + 1/20 Taking LCM of 8, 12, 15, 20 = 120: 1/8 = 15/120 1/12 = 10/120 1/15 = 8/120 1/20 = 6/120 R_total = (15 + 10 + 8 + 6)/120 = 39/120 = 13/40 In 3 hours, work done = 3 × (13/40) = 39/40 So after 3 hours, 39/40 of the tank is filled.

Step 3: Work done by tap A Tap A works from the beginning until the tank is full, i.e., for 3 + 3/25 = 78/25 hours. Work done by A = rate of A × time = (1/8) × (78/25) = 78/200 = 39/100 So tap A does 39/100 of the total work. Percentage of work done by tap A = (39/100) × 100 = 39%",,,,,
