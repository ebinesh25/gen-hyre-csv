objective,"Find the area of the triangle formed by the vertices (-2, 1), (6, 3), and (3, 8).",4,17,23,19.5,20.5,2,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","The area of the triangle with vertices (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3) is given by: Area = 1/2 * |x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)| Area = 1/2 * (-2(3 - 8) + 6(8 - 1) + 3(1 - 3)) Area = 1/2 * (-2(-5) + 6(7) + 3(-2)) Area = 1/2 * (10 + 42 - 6) Area = 1/2 * 46 Area = 23.",,,,,
objective,"Find the distance of the point F (7, -24) from the origin.",4,25,26,27,28,1,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","The distance from the origin (0,0) can be calculated using the distance formula: Distance = √((0 - 7)^2 + (0 - (-24))^2) Distance = √(49 + 576) Distance = √625 = 25 units.",,,,,
objective,"If the points P(1, 3), Q(S, 6), and R(5, 8) are collinear, then S =?",4,2/5,17/5,4,5,2,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","To check for collinearity, calculate the slope of PQ and QR and set them equal to each other: Slope of PQ = (6 - 3) / (S - 1) Slope of QR = (8 - 6) / (5 - S) Since the points are collinear, the slopes are equal: (6 - 3) / (S - 1) = (8 - 6) / (5 - S) 3 / (S - 1) = 2 / (5 - S) Cross-multiply and solve for S: 3(5 - S) = 2(S - 1) 15 - 3S = 2S - 2 15 + 2 = 2S + 3S 17 = 5S S = 17 / 5",,,,,
objective,"Determine the number of points, having both coordinates as integers, that are located within the interior of the triangle with vertices at (0,0), (0,27), and (27,0).",4,364,405,325,324,3,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","The triangle has vertices at (0,0), (0,27), and (27,0). The equation of the line connecting (0,27) and (27,0) is: x/27 + y/27 = 1 Therefore: x + y = 27 For interior points (strictly inside the triangle): x > 0 y > 0 x + y < 27 We need to count integer points (x, y) where x and y are positive integers and x + y < 27. Method: Count by summing valid y values for each x For x = 1: x + y < 27 means y < 26, so y ∈ {1, 2, 3, ..., 25} → 25 points For x = 2: y < 25, so y ∈ {1, 2, 3, ..., 24} → 24 points For x = 3: y < 24, so y ∈ {1, 2, 3, ..., 23} → 23 points ... For x = 24: y < 3, so y ∈ {1, 2} → 2 points For x = 25: y < 2, so y = 1 → 1 point For x ≥ 26: No valid positive y values Total number of interior points: Total = 25 + 24 + 23 + ... + 2 + 1 This is the sum of first 25 natural numbers: Total = n(n + 1)/2 where n = 25 Total = 25 × 26/2 Total = 650/2 Total = 325 Alternative Formula: For a right triangle with vertices at (0,0), (0,n), and (n,0), the number of interior lattice points is given by: Interior points = (n-1)(n-2)/2 For n = 27: Interior points = (26)(25)/2 = 650/2 = 325 Therefore, there are 325 interior lattice points in the triangle.",,,,,
objective,Calculate the area of the closed region bounded by the equation |x| + |y| = 4 in the two-dimensional plane.,4,32,16,16π,64,1,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","The equation |x| + |y| = 4 represents a closed region in the xy-plane. Step 1: Find the vertices of the region To find where the boundary intersects the axes, substitute x = 0 or y = 0: When x = 0: |0| + |y| = 4 → |y| = 4 → y = ±4 Points: (0, 4) and (0, -4) When y = 0: |x| + |0| = 4 → |x| = 4 → x = ±4 Points: (4, 0) and (-4, 0) Step 2: Identify the shape The four vertices are: (4, 0), (0, 4), (-4, 0), (0, -4) Connecting these points forms a square rotated 45° (diamond shape). Step 3: Calculate the diagonal The distance between (4, 0) and (-4, 0) is 8 units. The distance between (0, 4) and (0, -4) is 8 units. Both diagonals = 8 units Step 4: Calculate the side length For a square with diagonal d, the side length s is: s = d/√2 s = 8/√2 = 8/√2 × √2/√2 = 8√2/2 = 4√2 Step 5: Calculate the area Area of square = s² Area = (4√2)² = 16 × 2 = 32 square units",,,,,
