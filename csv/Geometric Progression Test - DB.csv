objective,"If the first term of a G.P. is 8 and the common ratio is 2, find the 7th term.",4,64,128,256,512,4,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","Given, First term, a = 8 Common ratio, r = 2 Nth term of G.P., an = ar^(n-1) a7 = 8 * 2^6 = 8 * 64 = 512.",,,,,
objective,"The sum of the first three terms of a G.P. is 14, and their product is 64. Find the common ratio.",4,2,4,8,16,1,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","Answer: A. 2 Explanation: Let the three terms of the G.P. be a, ar, and ar². Given: Sum: a + ar + ar² = 14 ... (1) Product: a × ar × ar² = 64 ... (2) From equation (2): a³r³ = 64 (ar)³ = 64 ar = 4 (taking cube root) This means the middle term ar = 4. Since ar = 4, we have a = 4/r. Substituting a = 4/r into equation (1): (4/r) + 4 + 4r = 14 4/r + 4r = 10 Multiply through by r: 4 + 4r² = 10r 4r² - 10r + 4 = 0 2r² - 5r + 2 = 0 (2r - 1)(r - 2) = 0 Therefore: r = 2 or r = 1/2 Case 1: If r = 2, then a = 4/2 = 2 Three terms: 2, 4, 8 Sum: 2 + 4 + 8 = 14 Product: 2 × 4 × 8 = 64 Case 2: If r = 1/2, then a = 4/(1/2) = 8 Three terms: 8, 4, 2 Sum: 8 + 4 + 2 = 14 Product: 8 × 4 × 2 = 64 Both solutions are valid. Among the given options, the common ratio is r = 2.",,,,,
objective,"The number 512 is which term in the following Geometric sequence: 8, 32, 128, 512, ...",4,3,4,5,6,2,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","Here, a = 8 and r = 4. The nth term of a G.P. is given by: an = ar^(n-1) So, 512 = 8 * 4^(n-1) 4^(n-1) = 64 4^(n-1) = 4^3 n - 1 = 3 n = 4.",,,,,
objective,"If the nth term of a GP is 625, and both the first term 'a' and the common ratio 'r' are 5, find the number of terms in the GP.",4,3,4,5,6,2,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","nth term of a GP, an = 625 First term of GP, a = 5 Common ratio, r = 5 Nth term of G.P., an = a * r^(n-1) 625 = 5 * 5^(n-1) 5^(n-1) = 125 5^(n-1) = 5^3 n - 1 = 3 n = 4 Therefore, there are 4 terms in the GP.",,,,,
objective,What is the sum of an infinite geometric series with the first term equal to 3 and a common ratio of 2/5?,4,5,15/2,6,10/3,1,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","By the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series, we have: S = a1 / (1 - r) S = 3 / (1 - 2/5) S = 3 / (3/5) S = 5.",,,,,
objective,"A rubber ball is dropped from a height of 64 meters. It bounces back rising to a height of 32 meters. Each time it further touches the floor, it rises to half the height it fell from before the previous bounce. Find the total distance traveled by the ball.",4,128,160,192,256,3,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","Answer: C. 192 Explanation: The ball's journey consists of: Initial drop: 64 m (downward) First bounce: rises 32 m (upward), then falls 32 m (downward) Second bounce: rises 16 m (upward), then falls 16 m (downward) Third bounce: rises 8 m (upward), then falls 8 m (downward) And so on... Total distance = 64 + 2(32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + ...) The bouncing heights form a geometric series: 32, 16, 8, 4, ... First term a = 32 Common ratio r = 1/2 Sum = a/(1-r) = 32/(1/2) = 64 Therefore: Total distance = 64 + 2(64) = 64 + 128 = 192 meters",,,,,
objective,"A rubber ball is dropped from a height of 64 meters. It bounces back rising to a height of 32 meters. Each time it further touches the floor, it rises to half the height it fell from before the previous bounce. Find the total distance traveled by the ball.",4,320,128,144,160,1,Aptitude,medium,5,"Aptitude,Numbers","Let the initial height be 64 m and the bounce ratio r = 1/2. The ball first falls 64 m. After the first bounce, it rises to 32 m and then falls 32 m. Each subsequent bounce, it rises and falls to half the previous height, forming a geometric series. Total distance = initial fall + 2 × sum of remaining infinite geometric series = 64 + 2 × (32 / (1 - 1/2)) = 64 + 2 × 64 = 64 + 256 = 320 m Hence, the total distance traveled by the ball is 320 m.",,,,,
